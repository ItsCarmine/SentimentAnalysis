"One of the other critics mentioned that after watching just one episode of Oz, you'll be addicted. They're right, because that's exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that hit me about Oz was his brutality and endless scenes of violence, which got to the right of the word GO. Believe me, it's not a show for weak or shy hearts. This show doesn't punch at anything about drugs, sex or violence. the nickname given to the penitentiary of the maximum security state of Oswald. It focuses mainly on the city of Emerald, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face to the inside, so that privacy is not at the top of the agenda. Em City is the home of many...Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more... if schuffles, eyes of death, dodgy transactions and shady chords are never far away.<br /><br />I would say that the main call of the show is due to the fact that it goes where Other shows would not dare. Forget about pretty pictures painted for the general public, forget the charm, forget the romance... OZ doesn't make any noise. The first episode I've ever seen hit me as so mean it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I looked more, I developed a taste for Oz, and I got used to the high levels of graphic violence. prisoners being turned into prison sluts because of their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing ... it is if you can get in touch with your darker side.",positive
"A wonderful little production. <br /><br />The filming technique is very unlikely- very ancient- BBC mode and gives a comforting and sometimes embarrassing sense of realism to the entire room. <br /><br />The actors are extremely well chosen- Michael Sheen not only ""has got all the polari"" but he has all the voices down too! You can really see the transparent edition guided by references to Williams' journal entries, not only is it well worth looking at, but it is a wonderful writing and A masterful production about one of the great masters of comedy and his life. <br /><br />Realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than using the traditional techniques of ""dream"" remains solid, then disappears. It plays on our knowledge and our senses, especially with the scenes concerning Orton and Halliwell and the scenery (especially of their apartment with the wall paintings of Halliwell decorating each surface) are terribly well made.",positive
"I thought it was a wonderful way to spend time on a hot summer weekend, sitting in the air-conditioned theater and watching a comedy with a light heart. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is spiritual and the characters are friendly (even the good bread suspected serial killer). Although some may be disappointed when they realize that it's not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style that many of us grew up to love.<br /><br />It was the Although I was never impressed by Scarlet Johanson, in this she managed to tone her ""sex"" image and jumped straight into an average, but animated young woman.<br /><br />This may not be the jewel of the crown of her career, but he was more spiritual than ""Devil Wears Prada"" and more interesting than ""Superman"" a great comedy to go see with friends.",positive
"Basically, there is a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks there's a zombie in his closet and his parents fight all the time.<br /><br />This movie is slower than a soap-opera... and suddenly Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie.<br /><br />OK, first when you're going to make a movie, you have to decide if it's a thriller or a drama! As a drama the movie is observable. Parents divorce and argue as in real life. I expected to see a similar movie from BOOGEYMAN, and instead I watched a drama with meaningless thriller spots.<br /><br />3 out of 10 just for parents and well played downhill dialogues. As for the photos with Jake: just ignore them.",negative
"Mattei offers us a vivid portrait of human relations. It's a film that seems to tell us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. <br /><br />It's a variation on Arthur Schnitzler's play on the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. We are led to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.<br /><br /> The only thing we get from all these souls in the image is the different stages of the solitude that each one lives. A big city is not exactly the best place where human relations find a sincere fulfillment, as we discern it with most people. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented casting bring these characters back to life. <br /><br />We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and look forward to his next work.",positive
"Probably my favorite film of all time, a story of self-denial, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it's not preaching or boring. It never ages, despite having seen it fifteen times or more in the last 25 years. Paul Lukas' performance brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of his few truly friendly roles, is a pleasure. What is happening in the world and under its own roof is credible and surprising. If I had a dozen inches, they would all be ready for this film.",positive
"I would like to see the resurrection of a series of Seahunts with the technology they have today, which would bring back the excitement of the children into me.I grew up on black and white television and Seahunt with Gunsmoke were my heroes every week.You have my vote for a return of a new hunt to the sea.We need a change of pace in television and it would work for a world of underwater adventure.Oh thank you for a point of view like this one on television and the many movies. It would be nice to read more about sea hunting.If my rhymes were 10 lines, would you let me submit, or would you leave me in doubt and ask me to give up, if that is the case, then I have to go do it.",positive
"This show was an amazing, fresh and innovative idea in the 1970s when it was first broadcast. The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but things fell after that. In 1990, the show was no longer really funny, and it continued its decline further in the complete waste of time it is today.<br /><br />It's really shameful until this show fell. The writing is painfully bad, the performances are almost as bad - if not for the slightly entertaining respite of the guest-guests, this show would probably not be a good idea. I find it so hard to believe that the same creator who chose by hand the original casting also chose the band of hacks that followed. How can one recognize such a shine and then see to replace it with such a mediocrity? I felt that I had to give 2 stars out of respect for the original casting that made this show so great a success. As it is now, the show is just horrible. I can't believe it's still on the air.",negative
"Encouraged by the positive comments on this film here, I was looking forward to watching this film. Bad mistake. I saw 950+ movies and it's really one of the worst of them - it's terrible in almost all respects: editing, pacing, storyline, 'action,' soundtrack (the only song in the film - a lame piece of country - is played no less than four times). The film seems cheap and mean and is boring to the extreme. Rarely have I been so happy to see the credits of ending a film. <br /><br />The only thing that prevents it from happening here. It's Harvey Keitel - while it's far from his best performance, he seems to make at least a little effort. One for Keitel only obsessive.",negative

"Phil the Alien is one of those weird movies where humor is based around the strangeness of everything rather than real punch lines.<br /><br />At first, it was very strange and quite funny but as the film progressed, I no longer found the jokes or strangeness funny.<br /><br />It's a low-budget film (which is never a problem in itself), there were quite interesting characters, but I ended up losing interest.<br /><br />I imagine this film would appeal to a star who is currently participating.<br /><br />For something similar but better try ""Bother of another planet""",negative
"I saw this film when I was about 12 years old when it came out. I remember the most frightening scene was the big bird eating men bathing powerless parachutes in the air. Horror. Horror.<br /><br />As a young child going to these B cheese movies Saturday afternoon, I was still tired of the formula for these monster-like movies that usually included the hero, a beautiful woman who could be the daughter of a teacher and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end. I love them now for involuntary humor.<br /><br />But, about a year later, I saw Psycho when he came out and I loved that the star, Janet Leigh, was hit early in the movie. I sat down and took note at that time. Since the writers invent the story, do it to be as scary as possible and not a well-written formula. There are no rules.",negative
"I enjoyed his postal film (perhaps just like it). Boll apparently bought the rights to use Far Cry a long time ago, even before the game itself was even over. <br /><br />People who liked to kill merc and infiltrate secret research laboratories located on a tropical island should be warned, that it's not Far Cry... This is something that Mr. Boll screened together with his legion of schmucks.. Feeling lonely on the tray Mr. Boll invites Three of his compatriots to play with. These players go by the names of Til Schweiger, Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller.<br /><br /> Three names that really made them quite big selfs in the movie biz. So the story goes like this, Jack Carver played by Til Schweiger (yes Carver is German all greet the bratwurst eat the guys!!) However, I find that Tils playing in this movie is pretty badass.. We see the bad scientist Dr. Krieger played by Udo Kier, making genetically mutated soldiers or GMS as they are called. Carry out his top secret research on an island that reminds me of ""SPOILER"" Vancouver for some reason. It's just no palm trees here. Instead, we got some nice rich lumberwood. We didn't even go FAR before I I started at CRY (mehehe) I can't go any further.. If you want to stay faithful to Bolls Shenanigans then go and see this film you won't be disappointed that it delivers the real experience of Boll, which means that most of it will suck.<br /><br />There are things that deserve to be mentioned that would imply that Boll did a good job on certain areas of the film such as some beautiful boats and fighting scenes. Until the whole team of GMS cromed/albino enters the scene and makes me laugh.. The film Far Cry reeks de scheisse (it's poop for you the simple) of a fa,r if you want to take a wiff go ahead.. BTW Carver gets a very boring sidekick that makes you want to shoot him the first three minutes that he is on screen.",negative
"The cast played Shakespeare.<br /><br />Shakespeare lost.<br /><br />I understand that it's trying to bring Shakespeare to the masses, but why ruin something so good.<br /><br />Is it because 'The Scottish Play' is my favorite Shakespeare? I don't know. What I know is that a certain Rev Bowdler (hence bowllerization) tried to do something similar in Victorian times.<br /><br /><br />In other words, you can't improve perfection.<br /><br />I don't have to write anymore but as I have to write at least ten lines of text (and the English composition was never my strong I'll just have to go on and say that this film, as the saying says, does not cut it.",negative
It is a fantastic film of three prisoners that become famous. One of the actors is George clooney and I am not a fan but this roll is not bad. Another good thing about the film is the soundtrack (The man of constant pain). I recommend this film to everyone.,positive
"A little attracted to erotic scenes, only to realize that it was one of the most amateur and incredible pieces of film I've ever seen. A little like a high school movie project. What did Rosanna Arquette think?? And what was with all these stock characters in this weird city supposed Midwest? Rather difficult to get involved with this one. No lessons to learn from him, no brilliant ideas, just stubborn and ridiculous enough (but a lot of skin, if that intrigues you) video nonsense... The bisexual relationship, out of nowhere, after all heterosexual encounters. And what was with this absurd dance, with everyone playing their stereotypical roles? Give this one a pass, it's like a million other miles of bad film, wasted, money that could have been spent on hungry children or AIDS in Africa...",negative
"Some movies simply shouldn't be redone. It's one of them. In itself it's not a bad film. But it can't capture the flavor and terror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as it is always, and most of the casting stands up, with the exception of Owen Wilson, who didn't bring the right sensation to Luke's character. But the main fault of this version is that he got too far from Shirley Jackson's story in his attempts to be grand and lost a part of it. the thrill of the previous film in an exchange for snazzier special effects. Again, I will say that in itself it is not a bad film. But you will appreciate the friction of terror in the old version much more.",positive
"This film became one of my 10 most horrible films. Horrible. <br /><br />There was not a continuous minute where there was no fight with one monster or another. There was no chance for a character development, they were too busy running from one sword fight to another. I had no emotional attachment (except for the great bad machine that wanted to destroy them) <br /><br />The scenes were openly stolen from other films, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. <br /><br />Examples<br /><br />>The ghost scene at the end of the film was the same as the one I had ever seen before. The end was stolen from the final scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda, Obee One and Vader. <br /><br />>The spider machine at first was exactly like Frodo being attacked by the spider in the Return of the Kings. (Elijah Wood is the victim in both films) and wait ......he hypnotizes his victim and wraps them.....uh hello??<br /><br />>And the whole theme of the machine against humans was the Matrix..or Terminator....<br />There are other examples but why waste time? And someone will tell me he The movie couldn't decide if it was a children's movie or an adult movie and wasn't much of either. <br /><br />Just horrible. A real disappointment to say the least.

"I remember this film, it was the first film I had watched in the cinema the picture was dark in places where I was very nervous it was back in 74/75 my father took me my brother & sister to the Newbury cinema in Newbury Berkshire England. I remember the tigers and lots of snow in the movie also the appearance of actor Grizzly Adams Dan Haggery I think one of the tigers gets shot and dies. If anyone knows where to find it on DVD etc. please let me know. The cinema has now been shot in a fitness club that is a very good one. The great shame, because the closest cinema is now 20 miles away, would like to hear others who have seen this film or any other like it.",positive
"A horrible film! It had to be against a few real stinks to be nominated for the Golden Globe. They took the story of the first famous Renaissance painter and massacred him beyond recognition. My complaint is not that they took liberties with the facts; if the story was good, it would be perfectly good. But it's just weird -- by all the stories the true story of this artist would have made for a much better film, so why did they find this script in dough? There are not enough naked people in the factual version. It is precipitated in the end with a summary of the artist's life -- we could have saved ourselves a few hours if they had favored the rest of the film with the same brevity.",negative
"After the success of Die Hard and his sequels, it's not surprising that in the 1990s a host of films ""Die Hard on a ....."" cashed on the wrong guy, bad place, bad concept of time. That's what they did with Cliffhanger, Die Hard on a mountain just in time to save Sly's career 'Stop or My Mom Will Shoot' Stallone.<br /><br />Cliffhanger is a great dream of nit-pickers, especially to those who are experts in mountain climbing, base-jumping, aviation, facial expressions, actor skills. But if you forget all the absurdities, it is in fact a very pleasant and undeniably entertaining trail that delivers like many strong sensations, and unwittingly, a lot of laughs.<br /><br />You must love John Lithgows sparkling malness, his tick every bunch of boxes of junk, and above all, the constantly harassed and merciless agent, Rex Linn like Travers.<br /><br />He can of Henry in ""Portrait of a Serial Killer"" but Michael Rooker is remarkable for a performance worthy of a horsehair like Hal, he constantly insists on shouting in the painful unbelief to his captors ""that man never hurts anyone"" And although he certainly can't be, it really seems that the character Frank of Ralph Waite smiles that the girl darks at his death.<br /><br />Mention also has to go to the former actor of ""London Burning"" Craig Fairbrass as the British villain, who comes a cropper while using Hal as a human football player, Yes, you can't help enjoy this little, Hal needed a good kick.<br /><br /> So forget your best judgment, which cares if 'this could never happen', lower your active expectations, raise the volume and enjoy!

"I had the terrible misfortune of having to see this ""b-movie"" in its entirety.<br /><br />All I have to say is-- save your time and your money!!! This must be the worst b-movie of all time, it should not even be called a b-movie, more like a f-movie! Because it fails in all aspects that make a good film: the story is not at all interesting, all the actors are paper-end and not at all credible, it has a bad direction and the sequences of action are so false it's almost funny.......almost.<br /><br The film is just full of a rotten liner that no respectable person could find fun in the slightest bit.<br /><br />This film is supposed to be oriented towards men, but all the women in it are so unattractive, especially that this old ridiculed thing that comes to the end. They try to appear sexy in these strange and horrible costumes and they fail lamentably!!!<br /><br />Even some of the most ridiculous b-movies will still give you some laughs, but it's just too painful for Look!",negative
"What an absolutely beautiful film, if you have 2.5 hours to kill, watch, you won't regret it, it's too fun!

"First of all, let's take a few things directly here: a) I AM a fan of anime- has always been in fact (I have always watched Speed Racer all the time in kindergarten). b) I AM like several B-Movies because they are hilarious. c) I love Godzilla's movies. <br /><br />Move, when the film arrives first, it seems that it will be your usual B-movie, up to the shitty FX, but all of a sudden- BOOM! the anime comes! It's when the movie comes down WWWAAAAYYYYYYY.<br /><br />Animation It's VERY bad and cheap, even worse than what I remember from SPEED RACER, for criesakes! In fact, it's so cheap, one of the few scenes in the movie that I ""lively"" remember is when a group of children run away from a school... and it's the same kids more and more! FX are terrible, too; dinosaurs seem worse than Godzilla. Besides, the transition to live action to animation is unorganized, the dialogue & voice (especially the English dub I saw) was horrible and I begged my father to release the tape. The only thing that allowed me to survive was to make jokes and comments like robots & Joel/Mike on MST3K (you choose the season). Honestly, this is the only way to barely enjoy this film and survive it at the same time.<br /><br />Heck, I intend to show it to another friend otaku on Halloween for a B-Movie night. Because it's stupid, rather painful to watch and unintentionally hilarious at the same time, I give this film a 3/10, an improvement on 0.5/10 I (According to my ranking scale: 3/10 means roughly both boring and bad. As fun as counting up to three unless you find a way to make fun of it, then it will become as fun as counting up to 15.)",negative
It was the worst film I saw at WorldFest and it also received the least applause after! I can only think that it receives such recognition based on the amount of actors known in the film. It's great to see J.Beals but she's only in the film for a few minutes. Mr.Parker is a much better actress than the allowed part. The rest of the actor is difficult to judge because the film is so ridiculous and predictable. The main character is totally non-sympathetic and therefore boring to watch. A film that revolves around an actor who can't get a job doesn't seem very original to me. Neither the development of the cop. It feels like one of the many hetero-video films I saw in the 1990s ... And not even a good one in these standards.<br /><br />,negative
"Karen Carpenter's story shows a little more about the complex life of singer Karen Carpenter. Although she doesn't give exact facts, and details.<br /><br />Cynthia Gibb (Karen portrait) was not a beautiful election. She is a good actress, but plays a kind of very naive and stupid Karen Carpenter. I think the role needs a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality.<br /><br />Louise Fletcher role like Agnes Carpenter is great, she does an excellent job like Karen's mother.<br /><br />He has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album. Unfortunately, they were not, although this film was at the top of the score in the United States and other countries",positive
"""The Cell"" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying journey not only in the vast minds of a serial killer, but also in the minds of a very talented director. It is conclusive proof of what can be achieved if human beings release their inhibited imagination. It is the audacity at work, pushing thoughts to fall into formulas and clichés and create something really beautiful. It is the best film from the year to this day.<br /><br />I have read many complaints about this film, anywhere in any style and style. ""The Cell"" has just opened the door to another world of imagination. So, can we slam the door into his face and tell him, as well as his director Tarsem Singh, that we no longer want to? Personally, I would rather than host another Tarsem movie, and I would like to see someone try to challenge him.<br /><br />We all have I've heard of going into the spirit of a serial killer, and yes, I agree that the ""gender"" is a little overworked. The 90s were full of movies trying to portray what makes the serial tick killers; some of them worked, but the most failed. But ""The Cell"" didn't get on the same track, we were given a new twist, we are physically transported in the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject ever studied.<br /><br />I like how the film doesn't push us. It's true, I like the explanations with my films, but when a movie ventures on a new field, you have to let it do it. I noticed that the film was very dark when it showed reality, perhaps to contrast the bright visuals inside the brain of another. Nevertheless, the scenery was simply amazing. I wouldn't be surprised if this film brought back some Oscars in cinematography, the best costumes, the best directors and others. If it was mine that he would at least be named for the best image.<br /><br />I noticed that I kind of repeated myself. Not because there is nothing else If you enter the film with a very open mind and to make it take over with wonders and a breathtaking feast, then you are assured of a good moment. I guess this film was just a little too much for some people, writing it as ""bad"" or ""browsing"". I am a lot in the psychology and imagination of the human mind, so it was just down my alley. I left the theater, I heard a member of the audience say ""Whoever made this film If so, I want what he smoked.<br /><br />**** (of 4)",positive
"This film has tried to be too many things at the same time: stinging political satire, Hollywood blockbuster, sapous romantic comedy, family promo... the list continues and continues. It has failed miserably to all, but there was enough interest to prevent me from extinguishing it until the end.<br /><br />Although I appreciate the spirit behind WAR, INC., it depresses me to see such a clumsy effort, especially when it will be taken by its targets to reflect the absence of a serious criticism, rather than of simply the bad writing, the bad direction and the production of this particular film.<br /><br />There is a criticism to be made about the corporatization of the war.

We need to have a conversation. This little girl who was always hanging on to someone? I hated her and I had to mention it. Now, the final The scene transcends, I must say.

"The 'War movie' is a Hollywood genre that has been made and reworked so often that dialogue with clichés, the redesigned plot and the action sequences on the top seem inevitable for any conflict related to large-scale fighting. However, a war film sometimes arrives against the grain and gives life to a truly original and convincing story on the silver screen. A war film is not quite right. True, the film opens with a quick and dirty battle sequence that puts ""Glory"" the director Edward Zwick ashamed. However, ""Cold Mountain"" is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people of the time. The story focuses around Confederate soldier discontented Inman, played by Jude Law, who becomes disgusted by the horrible war and the evil of the country for the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the At first glance, this configuration appears formulaous since the romantic interest of returning home gives the public enough sympathy for the reticent soldier's tribulation on the battlefield. Indeed, the anterior segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.<br /><br />""Cold Mountain"" soon takes a radical turn, although, as the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (save occasionally the At the same time, at the farm, Ada's cultivated means prove to be of little use in the fields; soon it becomes a wild beast. Coming to the rescue of Ada is the course, hard as the Ruby Thewes nails, played by Renée Zellweger, who helps Ada to put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, to face the loneliness and isolation that the war seems to have caused. Ada.<br /><br />In these two contexts, a living, convincing and sometimes very troubling portrait of the war-torn South takes place. The characters with which Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, enriched by the wonderful performances of Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's father, Ray Winstone as an impenitent ""lawman"" of the South, and Natalie Portman as a young mother deeply troubled and isolated. The dark, invading message against the war, accentuated by an effective score, haunting and beautiful clichés from Virginia and North Carolina, is communicated to the public not so much by horrific battle scenes as by the scarlet land and the traumatized people for whom the war was fought. Although the weapons and tactics of the war itself have changed a lot over the last century, it is infernal effect on the earth is timelessly relevant.<br /><br />Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this dark mood for most The love story between Inman and Ada is clinging clinging clinging to the beginning and the end of the film, although the intrinsically distant, abstract and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way corresponds to the lamentable nature of the rest of the plot.<br /><br />Don't make a mistake, ""Cold Mountain"" has neither the traits of sentimental romance nor an inspiring war drama. is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain, but also to truly absorb the public in the life of a war-torn people and very desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions.",positive
"Edward Dmytryk's Crossfire is a distinctive thriller of suspense, an unlikely ""message"" film using the look and devices of the black cycle.<br /><br />Bivouacked in Washington, DC, a company of soldiers face their agitation hanging in bars. Three of them end up in a foreign apartment where Robert Ryan, drunk and belligerent, beat their host (Sam Levene) to death because he happens to be Jewish. Mitchum, who is assigned to Ryan's outfit. Suspicion falls on the second of the three (George Cooper), who disappeared. Ryan kills the third buddy (Steve Brodie) to ensure his silence before Young ends in it.<br /><br />Friended by a superior script by John Paxton, Dmytryk draws precise performances from his three stars Bobs. Ryan, of course, makes his prototypic Angry White Male (and at the hilet), while Mitchum subjoue with his characteristic nonchalance alert (his role, however, is not central); Younger may never have been better. Gloria Grahame gives him the first complete rendering of the intelligent and vulnerable tramp, and, like a sad bag that is wrapped in his life, Paul Kelly haunts us in a small peripheral role that he makes memorable.<br /><br />The politically engaged Dmytryk may inevitably succumb to preaching, but it is rather limited to Young's reminisence of how his Irish grandfather died in the hands of bigotes a century earlier (so, by chance, stretching chronology At least there is no attempt to explain, however glib, why Ryan hates the Jews (and the hillbillies and...).<br /><br />Sorry, Crossfire survives even the major change that he brought - the novel on which he is based (Richard Brooks' The Brick Foxhole) referred to a gay-blasing murder. But homosexuality in 1947 was still beyond the Pale. Anti-Semitism (studios always shake off the prospect of offending any potential buyer of tickets).<br /><br />But although the transition from homophobia to anti-Semitism generally works, the details are not so good. The victim chats with a young soldier alone, drunk, then invites him to his home seems strange, even though (or especially since) there is a girlfriend in the towing. This raises the question whether this scenario was inadvertently retained or left in as a discrete pipe to the original engine. Generating Ryan's murderous rage.",positive
"""Ardh Satya"" is one of the best films ever made in Indian cinema. Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani, this one is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema that has also proved to be a commercial success. Even today, Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all the main directors of India.<br /><br />The film tells the real story of the Mumbai police of the 1970s. The film describes the story of Anand Velankar, a young hot-blooded cop from a poor family. His father is a severe police officer. Anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies and the impact of his father's atrocities on his mother. Anand's approach to immediate action against crime is an inert desire for his own satisfaction at work. In a lot where Anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his elders, which leads to frustrations, as he cannot reach the desired Job-satisfied. Given the frustrations, his anger is expressed by excessive violence in the remand rooms and bars, also making him alcoholic.<br /><br />The Spirit in him is still alive, while he constantly fights the system. He is aware of the metro system, where the police and politicians are inertly associated from afar. Finally, it is suspended.<br /><br />The Direction is a master piece and a very hard core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand breaks up in the house of the gangter Underworld Rama Shetty to stop it, followed by a short conversation that is fantastic. In many scenes, the film has moments of hair lifting.<br /><br />The practical approach of Script is a major punch. Alcoholism, Corruption, Political Influence, Courage, Deceptions are all part of Mumbai These aspects are treated brilliantly.<br /><br />Finally, the films belong to the show One man, Om Puri representing Anand Velankar through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly.",positive

Meanwhile, the spectators tell us that when you bluff, you have to bluff until the end without fear of being caught or appearing ridiculous. He says: you can't bluff for a while and you can't bluff. So halfway, tell the truth. After having ended up doing it - bluffed only halfway and told the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and finally, love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of the troubles of Titta Di Girolamo. <br /><br />This first non-sympathetic character, a taciturous man, courteous on the point of 50, a man who will not even respond in kind to maidens and waitresses who say hello and goodbye, becomes at some point someone the viewer cares. At one point in his non-life, Titta decides to feel concerned about the appearance of ""ridicules"". The first half of the film can be described as ""sweet"" by some. It reveals in fact the days and nights of Di Girolamo in this hotel at a strangely disconcerted, deliberate rhythm, revealing seemingly banal and irrelevant details. However, scenes that may have seemed useless reveal how essential they are while this magistrally built and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. Di Girolamo - the man without imagination, identity or life, the insympathic character that you end up loving and feeling when you least thought about doing it - is also transmitted with elegantly edited sequences and a very interesting use of music (a theme by the Scottish group Boards of Canada particularly distinguished). <br /><br /> Never was the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat mafia more in disagreement than since the release of films such as Le Conseguenze dell'Amore or L'Imbalsamatore. Another interesting element was the way the film used the insomnia of the protagonist. Unlike The Machinist (and in a much more explicit way, the film Al Pacino Insomnia), The Conseguenze dell'Amore uses this condition to symbolize a deeper emotional discomfort that has been so deep in the darkness of the unconscious, it is almost impossible to point its cause (if there is one). <br /><br />The young and friendly waitress of the Sofia hotel (played by Olivia Magnani, granddaughter) and the memory of Titta's best friend, a man whom he has not seen for 20 years, unannouncedly provide a small window on the life that Titta finally (although temporarily at the beginning) accepts to watch again. Although it is never explicitly stated, the spectator knows that for a man like Titta, accepting The Consequences of Love will have unimaginable consequences. A film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in its time and does not concede anything to the The expectations of the spectator, Le Conseguenze dell'Amore is a beautiful representative of this quiet and discreet little Renaissance that has taken place in Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecittà in the second half of the 1970s. The world waits for Italy to produce more Il Postino dishes, more films of style La Vita è Bella... neglecting to explore beautiful creations like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore, L'Imbalsamatore and others.

"I watched this movie not really expected much, I got it in a package of 5 films, all were pretty terrible in their way for under a fiver so what could I expect? and you know what I was right, they were all terrible, this movie has some (and some stretch) interesting points, the occasional camcorder view is a good touch, the drummer is very like a drummer, that is, boring damned and, well, that's actually the problem is that his just so boring, in what I can only assume was a Trying to build the tension, a lot of nothing happens and when it does its quite fast-finger (I had my thumb on the button fast front, ready to press for most of the movie, but gave a boost) and seriously is the main singer of the band that super looking, because they don't mention half how beautiful it is a hell of many, I thought it looked a little like a meercat, all this and I didn't even mention the killer, I'm not even going to go in, it's just not worth explaining. Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, I'm not even going to go in, it's just not worth explaining.

"I bought this movie from Blockbuster for $3.00, because it sounded interesting (a little Ranma-esque, with the idea of someone hanging around a skeleton), because there was a cute girl in a mini-skirt on her back, and because there was a Restricted Viewing sticker on it. I thought it would be a sweet or at least sincere story to come of age with a weird indie edge. I was 100% fake. the little violence, and the thing closest to nudity (honestly! I won't often hope it!) is when the girl is in her nightshirt and you see her panties (you see her panties a lot in this movie, because whatever, she wears a miniskirt of some kind). Even anti-religious humor is tamed (and lame, caricatured, incredulous, derived, non-original, and the worst of all not funny in the least--it would be better to listen to Ray Stevens ""Wuld Jesus Wear a Rolex on His Television This would hardly be qualified as PG-13 (it is not noted), but Blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of 17 rent this-- as if it were pornographic. Any little child could go in there and rent the edited version of Requiem for a dream, but they insist that Zack and Reba is worse.<br /><br />It's, but not that way.<br /><br /> In a way, it worries me--the only thing that could offend people is the idea of suicide at the beginning. If these two films were rated R only because of the suicidal aspect, then I'm unlikely to turn a story I wrote into a PG-13 film (the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve). Suicide is one of the three main causes of death among teenagers (I think it's number 2), so the chances are that most teenagers have been or will be affected by it.<br /><br /> Just say no to this film, however. 2/10.",negative

"Have you ever watched a movie that lost the plot? Well, it didn't even have one to start with.<br /><br /> Where to start? The painful scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with in fact no feeling of threat or even pre-enchantment created even during apparently constant thunderstorms (which are strangely never really heard in the large double glazing house)? The house that is apparently a few kilometers away from a city is still a few hours away(?) or the third girl who doesn't serve as a goal at the time? the plot except to provide a surprisingly fast gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable? Or even the beginning that suggests a 20+ spat killing throughout the region even though it is apparent that the killer never ventures away from home? Or the bizarre ritual with salt and pepper that sums up pretty much the lack of direction inherent in most of the movies.<br /><br />Add a lead actress who can't act but at least is ready to make completely irrelevant naked shower scenes and this video is really mean, but not as you hope.<br /><br />Having a suite just for being banned in the United Kingdom in the 1980s (mainly because of a surprisingly prolonged murder) it offers nothing but a value of curiosity- and a classic murder 'daft' (don't worry-his telegraphed at least ten minutes before).<br /><br />After a walk in the woods our victim gets to a rather steep slope upwards that they obviously struggle. Halfway they see a figure at the top dressed in black and waving a big one Scythe. What are they doing? Slide and run like us?

"After sitting through this pile of manure, my husband and I wondered if it was actually the product of an experiment to see if a computer program could produce a film. It was this list without and formula. But the American propaganda thrown into your face throughout the film proves - unfortunately - that it is the work of humans. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes as, ""We must steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it"" seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq, etc. The fact that Nicholas Cage launches lines like, ""I would never use the Declaration of Independence as a trading chip"" with a right face made me and my husband wonders if the whole casting took Valium before shooting each scene. The ""reasoning"" behind every plot trick and new ""clue"" is really ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there is also a bonus side misogyny plot, with Dr. What-Her-Name-Was being pissed off by all involved to ""never close."" She is clearly in the film only for the looks, But they felt the need to slap a title of ""Dr."" on her character to give her a little gravity. At one point, the character of Cage says, ""Do you never close her?"" and the camera pans to her watch poutily towards her hands, as she is a child. Really grotesque.

The production was good; however, the script and actor were of B-movie quality. The casting was poor because there were good actors mixed with cumby actors. The good actors did not hold their own and did not raise others. <br /><br />This film is not worthy of more words, but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. play cartoons of themselves in other movies. <br /><br />If you are looking for crazy entertainment, I would still not recommend this film.",negative
"This film is based on Han Suyin's book, ""A Many Splendored Thing"" and addresses issues of race relations between Asians and Whites, a subject that comes from Han's personal experiences as Eurasia growing up in China. This background, and the magnificent frames of Hong Kong, gives this love story a unique and rather bold atmosphere for its time.<br /><br />Otherwise, history is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that is perhaps more recalled than the film itself. Jennifer Jones looks at the role and gives a wonderful performance, Oscar nominated as a mixed race doctor during the advent of communism in mainland China. William Holden has never better played a romantic track as a journalist covering war-torn regions around the world. The actor is of the foreground, and chemistry between the two lovers provides authentic moments of affection of the silver screen sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined.<br />The cinematography really brings out 50's Hong Kong, especially the top of the hill overlooking the port where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments.

The cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with Gary goes around in circles and are not hit by a single ball/pellet. MY is killed and Gary seems not to have noticed-damn this guy is difficult.

"I thought the ""Army of God"" agreed, and I thought maybe Ducher had improved and matured as a filmmaker. The film started with a chaotic comedy, and I thought, ""Well, maybe it's going to be better."" Unfortunately, it never was. The picture begins by presenting two former Mormon missionaries -- and it seems that the public will get to know them and look after them. An improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting a blatant disobedience on the part of missionaries (something that undeniably exists, but rarely at the level of the Dutch representation) and that becomes almost laughable.<br /><br />Dutcher's only success in this film is his successful alienation from his target audience. By portraying unrealistically and inaccurately the lives of Mormon missionaries, Ducher accomplishes nothing more than to irritate his mainly Mormon audience. The film does not in any way reflect reality. Missions are nothing like what the Dutch show (having served a Mormon mission myself I can attest to this fact) and gang life in California certainly contains much more explicit language than occasional light vulgarity.<br /><br />The conclusion, that I suppose was to reach out to the public and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all, was both amazing (mon, the whole mission gathers to see this elder sent home - and the mother and daughter stand right next to it). Next time, Dutcher, try to make a movie that SOMEONE can identify with.",negative

"As a disclaimer, I have seen the film 5-6 times over the last 15 years, and I have only seen the musical this week.

I think that she 'Let me dance for you stage' is one of the best parts of the film, a valid addition to musical comedy. The scenery, lighting, dance and singing are also much higher in the film, which should be expected, and was actually delivered. <br /><br />The songs that were in common with the musical are better made in the film, the news are pretty good, and the entire film is just more than the musical in my opinion, especially compared to a musical that has been The only bad point on the film is the obvious cuts between the talking actors, and the singers nicknamed during the singing portions for some of the characters, but their dance is impeccable, and the final product was more enjoyable than the musical",positive
Protocol is an implausible film whose only grace to save is that it features Goldie Hawn as well as a good distribution of supporting actors.

"The public was unable to see Preston Sturgis for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when he resurfaced and even appeared on television. Meanwhile, he had gained a reputation because Pauline Kael's THE CITIZEN KANE BOOK had suggested that the Herman Mankiewicz - Orson Welles script for KANE was based on the Sturgis script here. As mentioned at the beginning of this thread for the film on the IMDb website, Kael exaggerated his case.<br /><br /> About six narrators in turn dealing with the life of Charles Foster Kane: the newspaper (representing Ralston - the clone Henry Luce), the memoirs of Thatcher, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane, and Raymond the butler. Everyone has his or her different influences on Kane, reflecting their faith, disappointment or hatred of man. And of course everyone also reveals his or her own failures when they tell their version of Kane's story. Yes, like KANE, this is a legendary company leader - here is Tom Garner (Specer Tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to be at the head of the country's most successful railway system. But there are only two narrators - they are the man of Garner Henry's right hand (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This limits the view almost three dimensions that we get in Kane's time to Garner. Henry, when he tells, is His wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only Henry's flaws.<br /><br />typical example: Although he has worked to the end, Tom becomes increasingly anti-laborator in his last years. Trade unions are troublemakers, and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenigans. Henry describes Tom's confrontation with the Union in a great march, and how he has concerned him to the detriment of his family life. So we have two points of view about man, but one is pure white and the other pure black.<br /><br />I don't really hit THE POWER AND THE GLOIRE so as not to duplicate the success of KANE (few films do it - including all other Orson Welles films), but I am aware that the story is presented well enough to keep its interest to the end. And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore like his wife Sally, the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home.<br /><br />When they get married, Tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and their families the benefits he has never had. But in America great business success comes at a cost. Tom is deeply engaged in managing the railway empire (he extends it and constantly improves it). When Sally learns his unfaithful behavior, he destroys it.<br /><br />Tom also gets a complete shock (which makes him a martyr in Henry's eyes). Eve marries Tom, and presents him with a son - but he turns out to be Eve's son by Tom Tom Jr.'s son. (Philip Trent). The discovery of this incestuous cocu makes Tom go away.<br /><br />The film is not a total success - the action sometimes jumps unconvincingly. When Tom talks to his board of directors about his plans to buy a small rival train line, and he discusses the use of debentures to finance the plans. Sturgis comes from a rich environment, so he could bring in this type of detail. So, overall, it's a first-rate film.",positive

"As someone has already mentioned on this painting, it is very difficult to make a false documentary.

He starts to show his false hand about 20 minutes mark (with 60 minutes to watch), and the viewer begins to realize that he is caught in it.

"After Hitchcock's first successful American film, Rebecca was inspired by Daphne DuMarier's novel on Gothic romance and plot, he returned to some of the most familiar themes of his British era - misidentity and espionage. As the United States settled into World War II and the large-scale war effort of civilians building aircraft, weapons and other necessary militias, the burgeoning film entertainment company began to shoot paranoidly and often jingoist thrillers with war. These thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among good, law-abiding citizens. Knowing that the director was at home in this kind of spying, producer Jack Skirball approached Hitchcock to run a property he owned that dealt with corruption, wartime sabotage and a powerless hero pushed into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity. This often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25-year-old Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) who, while at work at a Los Angeles aircraft factory, meets a new employee Frank Frye (Norman Lloydd) and moments later is framed to commit sabotage. Fleeing authorities who do not believe his far-fetched story he meets several characters on His way to Soda City Utah and finally New York City. These memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful ""breaks"" and a popular model of billboard Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) who, during the worst crisis of his life as well as national security, he falls madly in love with! Of course in the country of Hitchcock, Patricia, kidnapped by the so-called saboteur Barry, falls for his sensor, adding a romantic tension to the mix.<br /><br />In good shape for this exit, Hitchcock brews A national network of old ladies, simple Joes, and respectable businessmen who double as secret terrorist agents who harbour criminals, shoot weapons and detonate bombs to move things. It is a formidable plot that takes time to move forward and once inflamed, culminates in one of Hitchcock's most memorable finals. Look for an incredible life like NYC's tourist attractions (all have been recreated by Hollywood art directors because of the ban on shooting war at public attractions). Saboteur may not be one of Hitchcock's most famous films, it's a popular b-movie that is definitely solid and engaging with a lot of smart twists and as usual - terrible Hitchcock villains. Don't forget to watch Hitchcock's cameo appearance outside of a drug store in the second half of the movie.

Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this film.<br /><br />The Dresser is the story of Sir, an aging shakespearean actor (Finney), and his dresser Norman (Courtenay), a sort of valet, putting on a King Lear production during the They are two men, each dependent on the other: Sir is almost powerless without Norman's help to cajole him, the wheelle, and intimidate him in directing his 227th performance of Lear. And Norman lives his life through Sir; without Sir to need him, he is nothing, or thinks he is, anyway.<br /> It is a film animated by characters; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters, and as such, he requires actors of the highest calibre to bring him to Finney, only 47 years old, is quite credible as a very old stage actor, very sick, petulant, brimming, but brilliant. He whistles and smokes to his companions even when they take their bows! And Courtenay is no less convincing as a blending trainer, who sometimes has to act more like a mother than a valet to his old employer. The employer is really the wrong term to use, however. Because, technically, their relationship is that of the employer and the employee, most of the time Sir and Norman Yes, there are others in the distribution of this film, but there is no doubt that the real stars are Finney, Courtenay, and Ronald Harwood's wonderful screenplay. This does not mean that there are no other beautiful performances, especially Eileen Atkins like the long-suffering stage director Madge. There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desires, old regrets, and what could have been.<br /><br />Although not spoken. About these days, it's interesting to remember that The Dresser has been nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Actor Nominations for Finney and Courtenay, Best Photo, Best Director (Peter Yates), and Best Adapted Scenario.<br /><br />I remembered it was a good film, but I wasn't ready to be as completely inseparable as I was from the beginning to the end.",positive
"What happened? What we have here is essentially a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented distribution, but somewhere the film loses. In fact, it never really started. There was a bit of excitement when we found out that Angie is not really pregnant, then find out that she is after all, but that was all. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie, was terrible and his whole character wasn't even close to being important to this film, other than doing it. I really would have liked to see more interaction between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe try not for a pure comedy, which unfortunately was not, but maybe a drama with comic elements. I think if the film did this, it could have been very funny since the two actresses are quite funny in their own way and sitting here I can think of many scenarios that would have been a riot.",negative

"DON'TTORTURE A DUCKLING is one of Fulci's previous films (and honestly, in terms of history, better...) - and although it's not the typical ""bloodbath"" for which Fulci is known - it's still a very unique and pleasant film.<br /><br />The story surrounds a small town where a series of children's murders occur. Some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations - either as suspects, or those who ""help"" the investigation (or in some cases both) - include the city police, a little time reporter, a beautiful and rich former drug addict, a young priest and his mother, An old man who practises witchcraft and her female protégé, a mentally handicapped city dweller, and a deaf/mute little girl. All these people are intertwined in the plot to create several twists and turns, until the real killer is revealed...<br /><br />Don'T TORTURE A DUCKLING is neither a ""classical"" giallo nor a typical movie of Fulci Gore. Although it contains elements of both - it is more than one murder in the old era Mystery, with darker subjects and some scenes of graphic violence (although nothing as loud as some of Fulci's later works). It's a well-written film with lots of twists that made me guess until the end. Recommended for fans of giallo/murder-mystery, or anyone looking to see some of Fulci's non-splattering films - but don't despair, DON'T TORTURE has even more than it's just a part of violence and dazzling. Some can be repelled by the subject of child murders, and a main woman is just a part of violence and dazzling. Character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys, which is also a bit disconcerting - but if this type of material doesn't bother you, then certainly give it a look. 8.5/10",positive

Salman however was good in the movie seemed young and refreshed but was worth the price of this DVD. The music was not bad enough it was nice enough. Usually Indian movies have at least two to three hours long but it was a very short film for an Indian movie. The American actress who played in the movie is from the hit Heroes series, Ali Larter. Her role was a lot to be desired. However, she looked good in the Indian dresses she was wearing. The whole film didn't have much to be desired and I hope Salman does much better on her next film.

"I don't know why the producers had to exchange on the name of a somewhat successful film franchise because the title suggests that this is a sequel to the first three films... which is not the case. Even though Brands Houston appeared in ""HP3"", he played a completely different character (he was, eight years longer) in this film.

"This film worked with some of the most predictable lines of history and shallow characters never seen. The writer obviously bought the playbook ""How to Write a Space Disaster Film"" and followed it play by game. In particular, the stereotypical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones about space - putting on a courageous show in the face of the disaster - has been done many times.<br /><br />Max Q seems to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw $50 million at the But, judging by the last half of the film that contained many lame attempts at special effects, the producers could only collect $50,000. To learn that the film was nominated for a ""Special Visual Effects"" Emmy absolutely got me gob-smacked.<br /><br /> I think a handful of high school students with a media study pass could have created more credible effects!<br /><br />And the plot holes are too many to mention.

Now, I'm not an expert at NASA, But it is certainly very unlikely that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator will suddenly maintain a power position in the control room when things start to take the form of a pear with the program. There is surely someone more experienced at Mission Control than the program manager would call rather than a twenty-nine-year-old who hasn't been in the control room before.<br /><br />The only grace to save for this film is Bill Campbell's work.

"Caddyshack Two is a good film in itself, but compared to the original he can't stack. Robert Stack is a horrible replacement for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason, while funny simply can't compete with Rodney Dangerfield. Ty Webb is funny, being the only character in the original. Most of the other characters in the film don't have the punch of the original (Henry Wilcoxon for example) except for hysterically funny lawyer Peter Blunt, being played by Randy Quaid. Each line he tells me reminds me of the originals humor, especially the scene in his office (I don't go in for avocado costumes or movements. I find out where you live and come to your home and beat your door with a f***ing baseball bat, make a bonfire with the chippindale, maybe roast that golden recover (arff arff arff) then eat.

If the film was a little granular, it could have added a ""depth factor"" to what was happening. I have no idea why this film has so hype around it other than the subject - but to be honest the necrophilic scenes in films like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q, among others, are more shocking than in AFTERMATH. Everything that talks about the film being on loneliness and any other way of deep philosophy is bull****. It's a expensive shit, beautifully filmed. It's not so shocking, it's not so disgusting. if you insist on seeing it - rent it.

"When I saw the jewel of Tobe Hooper, Crocodile, in 2000, I developed a great interest in the collegial/crocodile niche of the exploitation/monster genre. I look forward to a wayward producer to follow with several sequels to these delicious candy of camp goodness. If only Ed Wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts. With Ed writing scripts, and a room full of monks creating special crocodile effects on a computer, all we would need would be a crocodile forage casting With Russ Meyer's breasts and Ren Hoek's pectoral implants.<br /><br />Although Tobe Hooper has referenced his own films, Blood Surf has chosen to distribute a bunch of aging themes from the hum bucket of other films.

I was disappointed that the Crock could not try his tenor sotto voce with a soliloque on the environment... or the crocolic appreciation, but the quasi-captain Achab of the story did not get his tower of force speech. Perhaps in the years to come we will see a galloping Crock after a shooting in a golden sunset.

Turns out it's far too sordid for her own good, or bad, or whatever. Like this in many ways- not having a balance with sex and violence. Too much sex and it will turn into a prototypic porn, and not even with a lot of production quality compared to most professional porn films! And with the murder scenes, there must be at least a little tack, and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity, in the creation of the creature/killer/whatever. Insects of a Virgin has neither. It is sure to say that it is a nice movie without soul, even if it is not one of the worst ever made- It's just there that Japanese horn-dog fetishists put themselves on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their heads.<br /><br />In this case, we're given a photo team where the guys take pictures of some girls, nothing too dirty, and then through a dense fog they stay in a house one night and are chosen one by one by ""A Murderer"" as it is credited.

That's like saying, however, that the crusts are the best part of a bad tasting salad. In addition to this, the sex scenes, which become tedious through 'Gaira' and its indulgence in the long-running shots where everything by the Japanese censors is blurred anyway, are nicknamed by the actors (you would think that they seem to have enough fun, hence the need to let them 'talk' for themselves). But the general feeling of the Entrails of a Virgin is that of a scoundrel, where he is just there to be gawked to and without a piece of suspense or true horror (see as the last girl is gone alive, the virgin of the image, tries to prevent the murderer from going to her, which lasts five minutes that she continues to throw sticks at him!)

The film has just failed at many different levels which is quite disappointing because it had so much potential. The script was probably the worst.

He has the film soaked in style but he just can't get a good focus. He moves the film at a clumsy and slow pace. He moves from reality to what really happens in the book that quickly got bored. The real book in the film that is entitled ""The Number 23"" is a terrible detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to Carrey the story that just bothered me with tears. At this moment, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension.

Moreover, you can not emphasize with any of the characters and thus, have absolutely no particular interest to them.

"The Hollywood film industry is the most lazy in the world. It only needs a single blow to flood the theaters with the same old shit reinvented over and over again. Take superheroes for example, for every X-Man and Spiderman, there is Daredevil, Elektra, Ghost Rider and Hulk. Japanese horror remakes are even worse. It only took The Ring, which was perfect for the field (especially because of Mr. Gore Verbinsky), to bring a ton of horrors based on creepy women, for example The Ring 2, The Eye, Dark Water (which was Well, but useless), and the grudges.<br /><br />The first Gruge was not quite bad. It was scary most of the way, which is what one could expect from him. Moreover, the plot had some brains mixing narratives. Gruge 2 is exactly like the previous one; it could be a good thing, but hey, what boy Men in black II? Was it a good thing for xerox the whole scenario and just changing the villain? For Gruge 2, the criticism goes the same way.<br /><br />Angry fears, bad behavior (except for Amber Tamblyn), and There is Aubrey (Tamblyn) investigating what led her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) to death; Allison (Arielle Kebbel) who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident represented in the first film took place; and finally, an American family who saw strange things happening on the next apartment. Happy to say (and I mean) that everything is related to the end, but you don't have to rely on the In the meantime, ghosts continue to kill and kill, which seems to be even more dead than ten world wars or the Ebola epidemic.

"""Down Periscope"" has been in our library since his arrival at VHS. Since then, we have acquired the DVD and a digital from Cinema Now.<br /><br />This is a bizarre film that does not go militarily overboard as a pro or ass. It is first and foremost a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters, I am quite surprised that a sequel has never been offered.<br /><br />The film has won a sequel on a cult obsession, even among the very young.

"Deanna Durbin, Nan Grey and Barbara Read are ""Three Smart Girls"" in this 1936 universal film, which features Deanna Durbin to the cinema audience. He also features Ray Milland, Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, John King, Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady. It's a sweet story about three young women, now living in Switzerland with their divorced mother, who hears their father (Winninger) remarry. the help of the housekeeper / nanny, determined to stop the marriage. Knowing that the intention, called ""Precious"" (Barnes) is nothing but a golden gigogne helped and encouraged by his mother (Brady), they arrange for it to be presented to a rich count. This is arranged by their father's accountant (King). The man he chooses is a full-time drunkard (Auer), but the girls the mistake for a real rich account (Milland). What a mess.<br /><br />It is a delicious film, not cloir or too sweet at all, with Some nice performances, notably by Auer, Milland, Barnes and Brady. Young women are pretty and all do good work. The emphasis, of course, is on young Durbin, who is a natural actress and a beautifully trained singer. In fact, her voice as a young girl is much more even than she would be as an adult - she has no problem with high grades, as she did later because she put too much weight in the average voice. She sings a delicious ""Il Bacio"" in a police station.<br /><br />One of the nicest ones The things about the film is to see the father, played by Charles Winninger, do not want his children around - until he sees them and gets to know them. Barnes as the gold-digger is not just as young, but the mother of the girls looks up there, so the inference was probably the older man looking for his youth with a younger and glamorous woman. In fact, he finds the youth he was looking for in his daughters.<br /><br />Universal gives Durbin the great star building here - she has the last shot in the film. Ray Milland at This point was still in payment of his dues, and it will probably be a surprise even for movie fans how young and attractive he is.<br /><br />Very entertaining and of course, it led to a suite and great stardom for Deanna.",positive
"If anyone wonders why no one makes movies like before, with the conversation, the character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new, better and different, these people must take in this film and see the high-notch writing, the staging, and act that merges into a wonderful evening of observation on how things were once in Italy and England. Walker, Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson, and Michael Kitchens in the major roles. Under Mike Newell's direction, these actors make memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter's look.

Yes, they had all the correct biblical characters, but they didn't give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes, which held your interest throughout the first film. brush, Parting the ""RED Sea"",drowning ""Pharohs Armies"", ""building Sethi's Pyramides"", could have been made with today's technology on the scale of blockbuster films such as ""Lord of the Rings"" or the Matrix.

"Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile live actor. The English aristocratic snob in A Room With a View, an Irish thief passionate in In the Name of the Father, an impudent and violent butcher in Gangs of New York (in a performance ten times stronger than Adrian Brody in the Pianist) and like the outrageous Cristy Brown with cerebral paralysis in My left foot (to name just a few). His roles all influence each other, but each one is seperate, and quite unique. He changes completely, with every character he takes.

"I have never completely lost myself, but I was often partially lost and generally unclear about the motivation of the character. The film has the impression of joining points of intrigue to press it into its time slot.<br /><br />If it was longer, it could make more sense, but it would still not be much good. The most interesting idea of the film is to the war between Zeus and Hera as being a war between the male and the female, but the film drops the ball on this, making Hera's disciples rather horrible while not being clear about what Zeus's disciples do or believe. The film is also interesting because you do not see the gods and there is no real certainty that they exist. Antagonistic sons. Not invisible but also not worth looking at.",negative

I like Ed Wood's films because it's so inept that it's very funny. But people!!! ""The cold"" is not funny and is not even ""interesting"".

"I have been a Mario fan as long as I can remember, I have very expensive memories of playing Super Mario World as a child, this game brought back many of these memories while adding something new. Super Mario Galaxy is the last episode in the incredible franchise Mario. There are a lot of very different things from this game from any other Mario before it, while preserving intact the greatest elements of Mario, the first notable difference is that the story takes place in space.<br /><br />The story begins Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach inviting him to celebrate his castle in the kingdom of mushrooms. Arriving at Peach Castle, Mario finds Bowser and his son (Bowser Jr.) attacking the castle with their dirigibles. Bowser removes Princess Peach and then lifts her castle in space. In the middle of the castle being raised in space, Mario falls and lands on an unknown planet. Mario is found by a talking star named Luma and is brought back to the Luma's Home, a floating space station, here Mario meets many other Lumas and also meets their leader, a woman named Rosalina. Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser has removed the Power Stars from the space station and dispersed them across the universe, it is up to Mario to help the Lumas find them and save Peach, so the adventure begins.<br /><br />The way you play the game is flying from the space station to other galaxies, each galaxy consists of several planets that Mario travels between levels via these Mario can repeatedly walk all around the planets without losing gravity, some planets are small and others are large, many planets are similar to the classic Mario environments. The best thing about the game are the commands, all that is like jumping and that's always the same, but the wimoote is used in many unique ways in this game. You shake the Mario remote control will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game, and it will also activate well You can also point the remote to the screen and use the pointer to pull bits of stars on enemies or objects in the environment. Then there are the graphics, these are by far the best graphics on the Wii, it's just so difficult to describe how much this game looks like, you could probably say it looks as good as some 360 games.<br /><br />My only minor handles is that the effect of uphill takes some to get used to, and also the story is pretty weak. The worst is that you lose everything of your lives when you turn off the game, no matter how much you have had when you left for the last time you will restart at 4 lives. Again these minor problems apart it is a superb game that is very entertaining and is very difficult. This is the type of game we have expected on the Wii.<br /><br />A perfect 10 out of 10!",positive
"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after just 1 Oz episode you will be addicted. You're right, as this is exactly what happened to me. <br /> <br />The first thing that hit me about Oz was its brutality and intrepid scenes of violence coming directly from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the weak hearts or shy. This show does not attract any blows in terms of drugs, sex or violence. It's hardcore, in the classic use of the word. <br /> <br />It's called Oz as it is The nickname given to the Oswalder High Security State Penitent. It mainly focuses on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all cells have glass fronts and face inward, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Arians, Muslims, Gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so squibbles, death stars, dodgy dealings and shady arrangements are never far away. <br /> <br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where it is going. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audience, forget charm, forget romance... OZ not confused. The first episode I've ever seen hit me as so evil it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but when I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got used to the high levels of graphic violence. Not only violence, but injustice (gecrooked guards sold out for a nickel, inmates who kill on order and get through with it, well behave, middle class Inmates who are turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street knowledge or prison experience) To watch Oz, you can feel comfortable with what is unpleasant contemplation....that's when you can get in touch with your darker side.",positive
"A wonderful little production. <br /> <br />The film technique is very inconspicuous- very old-time BBC fashion and gives a comforting and sometimes unpleasant, realism feeling for the whole piece. <br /> <br />The actors are extremely well chosen- Michael Sheen not only ""has all Polari"" but he has knocked down all the voices! You can really see the seamless editing led by the references to Williams diary entries, it is not only worth watching, but it's a great written and A masterful production about one of the great masters of comedy and his life. <br /> <br /> Realism really comes home with the little things: the imagination of the guard, which, instead of using the traditional 'dream' techniques, then disappears. It plays on our knowledge and our senses, especially with the scenes about Orton and Halliwell and the sets (especially their apartment with Halliwell wall paintings decoration each surface) are terribly well done.",positive
"I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a hot summer weekend, sitting in the air-conditioned theater and watching a lighthearted comedy. The plot is simple, but the dialogue is funny and the characters are adorable (even the good bread suspects serial killers). While some may be disappointed when they realize that this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us grew to love. Most of them I had laughed about one of Woody's comedies in years (that's a decade?). While I had never been impressed by Scarlet Johanson, she managed to set up her ""sexy"" image and jumped directly into an average but spirited young woman. <br /> <br />This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was funnier than ""Devil Wears Prada"" and more interesting than ""Superman"" to visit a great comedy with friends.",positive

"Petter Mattei's ""Love in the Time of Money"" is a visually impressive film to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait of human relationships. This is a film that seems to tell us what money, power and success do for people in the different situations we encounter. <br /> <br /> <br />This is a variation on the play Arthur Schnitzler on the same theme, the director transfers the action to today's New York where all these different characters meet and connect. way, or different to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous contact point. Stylish, the film has a refined luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat. <br /> <br />The only thing you come from all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness everyone lives in. A great city is not exactly the best place where human relationships find sincere fulfillment, as you can see, is the case with most of the people We meet. <br /> The acting is good under Mr. Mattei's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, let these characters come to life. <br />We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and wait eagerly for his next work.",positive

It just never gets old, although I've seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years. Paul Lukas' performance brings tears to the eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of her few really sympathetic roles, is a pleasure. The children, as Grandma says, are more like ""dressed-up girls"" than children, but that makes them just more fun to see.

"This show was an amazing, fresh and innovative idea in the 1970s when it was first aired. The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but things fell afterwards. Until 1990 the show was no longer really funny, and it continued its decline until the complete waste of time it is today. <br /> <br /> It is really shameful how far this show has fallen.

"I remember that the scariest scene was the big bird that ate men who were helpless with parachutes from the air. Horror. Horror. When a young child went to these cheesy B-movies on Saturday afternoon, I was still tired of the formula for these monster-type movies, which would normally be the hero, a beautiful woman who could be the daughter of a professor and a happy dissolution when the monster died in the end. I love her now for the unintentional humor. <br /> <br />But, about a year or so later, I saw Psycho when it came out and I loved the star Janet Leigh being rejected early in the movie.

"So in not a big fan of Boll's work, but then again not many are. I enjoyed his movie Postal (maybe in the only). Boll apparently bought the rights to use Far Cry long ago before the game itself was even finsished. <br />People who like to kill Mercs and infiltrating secret research labs on a tropical island should be warned that this is not Far Cry... This is something Mr Boll along with his Legion of Dirts. Feeling lonely on the set Mr Boll loads three of his compatriots to play.

So goes the story, Jack Carver played by Til Schweiger (yes Carver is German all hail the bratwurst eating guys!!) However, I find that Til's acting in this movie is quite chaotic.. People have complained that he doesn't really stay faithful to the entire Carver agenda, but we only saw carvers in one. first person perspective, so we don't really know what he looked like when he kicked a**.. <br /> <br />But the storyline in this movie is beyond the Demented. We see the evil crazy scientist Dr. Krieger played by Udo Kier, making genetic mutated soldiers or GMS as they are called.

"Some movies just shouldn't be made new. This is one of them. In itself, it's not a bad movie. But it fails to capture the taste and terror of 1963 film with the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as he is always, and holds most of the cast, except for Owen Wilson, who just didn't get the right feeling to the character of Luke. But the main flaw in this version is that it's too far from Shirley Jackson's story in his attempts, grandiose and lost some of the the thrill of the previous movie in a trade off for snazzier special effects.

"I'm an anime fan – that's always been a fact (I've seen Speed Racer all the time in preschool). b) I do it like several B-movies because they're hilarious. c) I like Godzilla movies a lot. <br /><br />When the movie arrives first, it seems like it's your usual B-movie, except for the fucking FX, but suddenly the anime comes! That's when the movie WWWAAAAYYYYYYY goes downhill. <br /><br />The animation is VERY bad and cheap, even worse than what I remember from SPEED RACER, for Crissakes! In fact, it's so cheap, one of the few scenes from the movie that I remember ""living"" is when a bunch of kids run from a school... & it's the same kids over & again! The FX are also terrible; the dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition, the transition to live action to animation is unorganized, the dialogue & voices (especially the English dub I saw) was terrible & I asked my father to take out the tape the DVD/VHS player; the only thing that survived me were jokes and comments like the robots & Joel/Mike on MST3K (you choose the season). Honestly, this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie and to survive it at the same time. <br /> <br />Heck, I plan to show this to another otaku buddy of mine on Halloween for a B movie night. Because it's stupid to see quite painful & unintentionally hilarious at the same time, I give this movie a 3/10, an improvement of the 0.5/10 I was originally to give. <br /> <br /> (According to my rating scale: 3/10 means quite a lot both boring and bad. So fun as to count three unless you find a way to make fun of it, then it will be as fun as counting to 15.)",negative
"This was the worst movie I've seen at WorldFest and got the slightest applause after that! I can only believe that he gets such recognition based on the number of well-known actors in the movie. It's great to see J.Beals, but she's only allowed for a few minutes in the movie. M.Parker is a much better actress than the part. The rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable. The main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a long time to see. is not a really emotional depth of the story. A movie about an actor who can't get a job doesn't feel very original to me. Also, the development of the cop doesn't. It feels like one of many straight-to-video movies I saw in the 1990s ... And not even a good one in these standards. <br /> <br />",negative
"The Karen Carpenter story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter's complex life. Although it fails to give accurate facts and details. <br /><br /> Cynthia Gibb (Portraits Karen) was not a good choice. She is a good actress, but plays a very naive and kind of stupid Karen Carpenter. I think that the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality.<br />Louise Fletcher's role as Agnes Carpenter is great, she does a great job as Karen's mother.<br /><br />It has great personality. Songs that could have been recorded in a soundtrack album. Unfortunately, they weren't, although this movie was on the top in the US and other countries.",positive
"""The Cell"" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying journey into not only the giant spirit of a serial killer, but also into a very talented director. This is a conclusive proof of what can be achieved when people unleash their uninhibited fantasies. This is boldness at work, the thoughts of falling into formulas and clichés and creating something really great. This is the best film of the year to this day. <br /> <br />I have read numerous complaints about this movie, everywhere from all style and The film is perhaps a milestone, a tradition in which future films will hopefully follow. ""The Cell"" has just opened the door to another world of imagination. So we can pop the door in the face and tell her and her director Tarsem Singh that we don't want to do more? Personally, I would more than welcome another film from Tarsem, and would like to see someone trying to challenge him. I have heard that one goes into the head of a serial killer, and yes, I agree that the ""genre"" is a little revised. The 90s were full of movies trying to show what serial killers tick; some of them worked, but most failed. But ""The Cell"" doesn't shine down the same trail, we're given a new twist, we're physically transported into the mind and examined with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject ever. down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually gets to enter another's brain. Instead, she just lies on a laboratory table and is with what looks like really long Twizzler and chased into another entity. ""The cell"" wants you to ""see"" what it's all about and not ""how"" it is, and I think that's what some people don't like. True, I like explanations with my movies, but if a movie dares on new ground you have to do it, what it does I noticed how the film was very dark when it showed the reality, perhaps to contrast the bright images in someone else's brain. Nevertheless, the set was just amazing. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie would take some Oscars in the camera, best costumes, best director and the like home. If it were up to me, it would at least be nominated for the best picture. <br /> <br />I noticed that I have somehow repeated myself. Not because there is nothing else. To say that, but because I can't emphasize enough how fantastic I thought ""The Cell"" was. If you're going into the movie with a very open mind and having taken it over with miracles and an eye-popping party, then you're sure a good time. I think this movie was just a little too much for some people, writing it off as ""female"" or ""crazy"". I'm a lot in psychology and the imagination of the human mind, so it was right in my alley. Leaving the theater, I heard an audience say, ""Whoever made this movie, ""If so, I want what he smoked. <br /><br />**** (of 4)",positive
"This film tried to be too many things at once: stabbing political satire, Hollywood blockbuster, sapid romantic comedy, family values promo... the list goes on and on. It failed miserably at all of them, but there was enough interest to keep me from stopping them until the end. <br /><br />Although I guess the mind behind WAS, INC, it depresses me to see such an unskillful effort, especially when it is taken from its goals to reflect the absence of a serious critique, instead of Just the bad writing, the directing and the production of this film. There is a criticism about the corporatization of war. But it is fun in this way to reduce the true cruelty of the event.

The little girl who always hangs on someone? I hated them and had to mention it. Now, the last movie was so frustrating. It's so gloriously bad and full of badness that it's a movie of its own.

"War film is a Hollywood genre that has been made and redesigned so often that clichéd dialogues, rehashed plots and over-the-top action sequences for any conflict that deals with large-scale struggles appear unavoidable. However, occasionally a war film comes to life, which goes against the line and brings a really original and convincing story to life on the silver screen. Mountain"" is not exactly a war movie. True, the film begins with a (literally) fast and dirty battle sequence, the ""Glory"" director Edward Zwick Sham. However, ""Cold Mountain"" is not as much about the civil war itself as it is about the time and the people of the time. The story revolves around disgruntled Confederate soldiers Inman, played by Jude Law, who with the gruesome war and homesickness for the beautiful hamlet Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the Just as beautiful southern Belle he left behind him, Ada Monroe, played by Nicole Kidman. At first glance, this setup seems formulaic, as the romantic interest at home gives the audience enough sympathy to overcome the tribulations of the reluctant soldier on the battlefield. Indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat forced. <br /><br />""Cold Mountain"" soon takes a drastic turn, although the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (by now saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of the Want to root for the Confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. Meanwhile, back on the farm, Adas cultivated species prove of little use on the fields, soon it will be transformed into something of a wild beast. coming to save Adas is the course, tight-as-nails Ruby Thewes, played by Renée Zellweger, who helps Ada to put the farm back together and, perhaps even more important, with the loneliness and isolation that the war seems to have brought Ada. In these two settings, a vivid, convincing and sometimes very disturbing portrait of the war-destroyed South unfolds. The characters with which Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances by Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's dead father, Ray Winstone as the unrepentant southern ""legislator"" and Natalie Portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. All have been severely affected and changed by ""the war of northern aggression"", especially for the worse. The dark, penetrating anti-war message, which is underlined by an effective, haunting score and cool, beautiful shots of Virginia and North Carolina, is not so much conveyed to the audience by cruel battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for whom the war was fought. Although the weapons and tactics of the war have changed greatly even in the past century, it is hellishly relevant to the country. Director Anthony Minghella manages to hold this gloomy mood for the most. the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather lukewarm climax that does little justice to the wonderfully shaped characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly directed towards the beginning and the end of the film, although the nature of its relationship, which is removed by nature, abstracted and even absurd, corresponds in a way to the dismal nature of the rest of the story. <br /> <br />Don't make a mistake, ""Cold Mountain"" has neither the characteristics of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. is a unique vision of an era that certainly not only entertains, but also really wants to take the audience into the life of a people torn apart by a war and completely get rid of its terrible effects.",positive
"Tough and organically gripping, Edward Dmytryk's Crossfire is an unmistakable tension thriller, an unlikely ""message"" movie with the appearance and devices of the Noir cycle. <br /> <br />Bivouacked in Washington, DC, a group of soldiers coping with their unrest by going to bars. Three of them end up in a strange apartment where Robert Ryan, drunk and belligerent, beats her host (Sam Levene) to death because he happens to be Jewish. Police detective Robert Young investigates with the help of Robert Mitchum, who is assigned to Ryan's outfit. Suspicion falls on the second of the three (George Cooper) who has disappeared. Ryan kills the third mate (Steve Brodie) to secure his silence before Young enters. <br />Dmytryk, abbreviated by a superior script by John Paxton, draws precise performances from his three leading roles with Bobs. Ryan naturally makes his prototypical Angry White Male (and Hilt), while Mitchum underplays with his characteristic alertness (but his role is not central); The boy may never have been better. Gloria Grahame gives her first full-fledged rendering of the clever, vulnerable tramp, and as a sad sack that is lurking into her life, Paul Kelly follows us in a small, peripheral role that he makes unforgettable. <br /> <br />The politically committed Dmytryk may inevitably succumb to preaching, but it is rather limited to Young's memory of how his Irish grandfather died in the hands of Bigots a century ago (by the way, stretching chronology At least there's no attempt to give an explanation as to why Ryan hates Jews (and Hillbillies and...). <br /> Crossfire even survives the great change that was made to it - the novel on which he is based (Richard Brooks' The Brick Foxhole) dealt with a homosexual murder. But homosexuality in 1947 was still beyond the Pale. News from the Holocaust, however, had begun to emerge from the ashes of Europe, so Hollywood felt encouraged to register his protest against it. Anti-Semitism (the studios always shivered at the prospect of insulting any ticket buyer). <br />But while switching from homophobia to anti-Semitism generally works, the details don't fit so smoothly. The victim chats with a lonely, drunk young soldier, who then invites him back home, looks strange, although (or especially since) there is a girlfriend in tow. It raises the question whether this scenario has been accidentally retained or left behind as a discreet hint to the original engine. To create Ryan's murderous anger.",positive
"""Ardh Satya"" is one of the best films ever made in Indian cinema. The film was directed by the great director Govind Nihalani, which is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema, which also proved to be a commercial success. Even today, Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all leading Indian directors. <br /> <br />The film tells the real-life scenario of the Mumbai police of the 70s. Unlike any police in other Indian cities, Mumbai police includes a completely different system. The film describes, among other things, the story of Anand Velankar, a young hot-blooded cop from a poor family. His father is a tough cop. Anand himself suffers from the ideologies of his father and the incidents of his father's atrocities against his mother. Anand's approach to the immediate fight against crime is an intrepid desire for his own job satisfaction. In a plot in which Anand's constant efforts against crimes are trampled on by his seniors, this leads to frustrations because he cannot achieve the desired job satisfaction. As a result of the frustrations, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms and bars and also turns him into an alcoholic. <br /> The spirit in him is still alive, because he is constantly fighting against the system. He is aware of the Metro system, where the police & politicians are an inertly associated with far end. In the direction of unethical practice it is negative. Finally it is suspended. <br />The director is a masterpiece & thoroughly hard core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand breaks into the underworld gangster Rama Shetty's house to arrest him, followed by a short conversation that is fantastic. On many scenes the movie Hair-raising has moments. <br />The practical approach to script is a great punch. Alcoholism, corruption, political influence, courage, deceptions are all integral part of Mumbai. Police still today. These aspects are treated brilliantly. Finally, the films belong to the one-man show, Om Puri portrays Anand Velankar through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly.",positive

The print quality is excellent, but that alone cannot hide the fact that the film is deadly boring.

"One of the most important quotes from the whole film is spoken halfway by the protagonist, mafia-middle Titta Di Girolamo, a physically non-descriptive, middle-aged man originally from Salerno in southern Italy. When we were introduced to him at the beginning of the film, he has been living for ten years in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italian-speaking canton of Switzerland and runs a business to which we are only gradually introduced. Inconspicuous scene takes place employees of the Swiss bank, who usually count Di Girolamo's cash, tell him that 10,000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of densely stacked banknotes. In the news he threatens quietly, but icily his koaxing bank manager, to close his account. Meanwhile he tells us the audience that if you bluff, you must bluff to the end, without fear, snatched out or appearing ridiculous. He says: You can't bluff for a while and Then half through, tell the truth. After finally doing this - bluffed only half through and told the truth, and accepting the consequences of life and finally, love - is precisely the reason for the beginning of Titta Di Girolamo difficulties. <br /> <br />This initially unsympathetic character, a creepy, cleaner, cures man on the edge of 50, a man who does not even respond in style to maids and waitresses who say hello and farewell, will be at one point someone who cares about viewers The first half of the film can be called ""slow"" by some. In fact, Di Girolamo reveals days and nights in this hotel at a strange, conscious pace that reveals seemingly banal and irrelevant details. Scenes that may have appeared unnecessary, however, reveal how essential they are, how this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds in front of your eyes. Di Girolamo - the man without imagination, identity or life, the unsympathetic character that one lets end unexpectedly loving and feeling when one least thought one would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music (a theme of the Scottish band Boards of Canada was particularly evident). <br /> <br />Never was the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat mobsters better than since the release of movies like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore or L'Imbalsamatore. Another interesting element was the way in which the film took advantage of the protagonist's insomnia. No different than The Machinist (and in a much more explicit way, the Al Pacino film Insomnia), Le Conseguenze dell'Amore uses this condition to symbolize a deeper emotional malaise that was so deeply rammed into the darkness of the unconscious that it is almost impossible to mark its cause (if there is actually one). <br />The young and sympathetic hotel waitress Sofia (played by Olivia Magnani, granddaughter). The legendary Anna) and the memory of Titta's best friend, a man he hasn't seen for 20 years, unexpectedly offer a tiny window on life, which Titta finally (although initially temporarily) accepts to look through again. Although it is never explicitly spread out, the viewer knows that a man like Titta, who accepts the consequences of love, will have unimaginable consequences. A film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in his own time and nothing to the The expectations of the spectator, Le Conseguenze dell'Amore, is a fine representative of this small, quiet, discreet renaissance that has been taking place in Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecittà in the second half of the 1970s. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postino-like food, more La Vita è Bella-style films... neglect, fine creations such as Le Conseguenze dell'Amore, L'Imbalsamatore and others to explore. Their loss, world.",positive

"I bought this movie at Blockbuster for $3.00 because it sounded interesting (a bit Ranma-esque, with the idea that someone pull around a skeleton), because there was a nice girl in a mini skirt on the back, and because there was a limited view sticker on it. I thought it would be a sweet or at least sincere coming of the age story with a strange indie edge. I was 100% wrong. <br /> <br /> <br />After I saw it, I have to ask myself how it got the restricted stickers, as there was hardly any dirty language, little violence, and the next thing to nudity (Honestly! I usually don't go around to hope it!) is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties (you see her panties a lot in this movie because no matter what, she wears a miniskirt of any kind). Even the anti-religious humor is tame (and lame, caricatured, insincere, derived, unoriginal, and worst of all not funny in the least - it would be better just to hear Ray Stevens ""Would Jesus wear a Rolex on his TV Show). This would hardly be considered PG-13 (it's not rated), but Blockbuster refuses to rent someone under 17 years this - as if it was pornographic. Any little child could go there and rent the edited version of Requiem for a dream, but they insist that Zack and Reba is worse. <br /> <br />It's, but not in this way. <br /> <br />In a way, that worries me - the only thing that could offend people is the idea of suicide at the beginning. If someone needs to see movies with honestly portrayed Suicides (not this, but better like The Virgin Suicides), they are teenagers. If both movies were classified as R purely because of the suicidal aspect, then I have little chance of writing a story in a PG-13 movie (the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve). Suicide is one of the three leading causes of death among teenagers (I think it's number 2), so the chances are that most teenagers are affected or will be.",negative

"Have you ever seen a movie that has lost the plot? Well, that didn't even really have a beginning. <br /> <br />Where to start? The painfully laborious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house without really a sense of threat or even foreshadowing that were created even during the seemingly constant thunderstorm (which strangely never actually belonged to the house-sized double glazing)? The house, which seems to be only a few miles away from a city, is still several hours away on foot(?) or the third girl, who has no purpose in order to the plot except to deliver a surprisingly fast Gory murder, how the tedium becomes intolerable? Or even the beginning, which suggests a spade of 20+ killings in the area, although it is obvious that the killer never dares far from home? Or the bizarre ritual with the salt & pepper, which quite a lot captures most films inherent lack of direction. <br /> <br />Feel a leading actress who can't act, but at least is ready to take some totally irrelevant naked shower scenes and this video is really nasty, but not in the way you hope. <br /> Given a simple ban in Britain in the 1980s (especially because of a last surprising over extended murder), it offers nothing but curiosity value and a classic 'daft' murder (no worry-their telegraphed at least ten minutes before). <br /> After a walk in the woods, our victim comes to a fairly steep upside that they obviously fight. Halfway through them, a figure at the top dressed in black and branding a large one. Scythe. What do they do? Slide down and walk like the rest of us?

"After sitting through this dung heap, my husband and I wondered if it was actually the product of an experiment to see if a computer program could produce a film. It was this listless and formulaic. But the US propaganda thrown in your face during the film proves - disappointing - that it is the work of man. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes such as: ""We must steal the declaration of independence to protect it"" seem like means to justify actions such as the invasion of Iraq, etc. The fact that Nicholas Cage lines like: ""I would never use the declaration of independence as a negotiating chip"" with a straight face made me and my husband ask if the entire cast took Valium in front of every scene. The ""reason"" behind every plot and new ""Klue"" is really ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there is also a bonus page plot by Misogyny, with Dr. Whatever-Her-name-what of all involved for ""Never Shutting up"". She is clearly in the movie only for looks, But they felt the need to hit a ""Dr."" title on her character to give her some gravity. At one point Cage's character says, ""Do you never keep still?"" and the camera whistles at her as she is a child, poutil looking down. Really grotesque.

"I had heard good things about ""States of Grace"" and came with an open mind. I thought that ""God's army"" was fine, and I thought that maybe Dutchman as a filmmaker improved and matured. The film began with a shaky acting, and I thought ""good, maybe it gets better."" Unfortunately, it never did. The picture begins with the introduction of two elders - Mormon missionaries - and it seems that the audience will learn to know them and grow to take care of them. Instead, the story degenerates into a very Unlikely series of unfortunate events that show the manifest disobedience of the missionaries (something that indisputably exists, but rarely on the level that Dutcher represents), and it almost becomes a laugh. <br /> Dutcher's only success in this film is his successful alienation of his target audience. By unrealistically and imprecisely portraying the life of the Mormon missionaries, Dutcher achieves nothing but to annoy his overwhelming Mormon audience. The film in no way reflects reality. Missions are nothing like what Dutcher shows (which I myself have served on a Mormon mission, I can testify to) and the gang life in California certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity. <br /> <br />The conclusion that I assume they should touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all was both incredible (c'mon, the whole mission gathers to see these elders home -- and the mother and the girl are right next door.

Was it just ignorance (""I remember something about Noah and animals, and Lot and Canaanites and all of them) the stuff from the Sunday school) or did they try to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible - from Christians, Jews and Muslims, to historians, archaeologists, geologists, psychologists, linguists ... in fact, no one was offended?

"Preston Sturgis' THE POWER AND THE GLORY was invisible from the public for almost twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it reappeared and even appeared on television. Meanwhile, it had gained popularity because Pauline Kaels THE CITIZEN KANE BOOK had proposed that the Herman Mankiewicz - Orson Welles script for KANE was based on Sturgis' script here. As mentioned at the beginning of this thread for the film on the IMDb website, Kael persuaded her case. <br /><br /> about six narrators who alternately deal with the life of Charles Foster Kane: the weekly newspaper (representative Ralston - the Henry Luce Klon), Thatcher's memoirs, amber, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane, and Raymond the Butler. Everyone has his or her other inclination on Kane, reflect their belief or disappointment or hatred of the man. And of course everyone shows his or her own mistakes when they tell their version of Kane's story. This method also leads to frequently overlapping re-tellings of The same incident. <br /> <br />This is not the situation in THE MOTOR AND THE GLOCK. Yes, like KANE it is a legendary business leader - here it is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who rose from below to the top of the country's most successful railway system. But there are only two narrators - they are Garner's right man Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This restricts the almost three-dimensional view that we get in times of Kane in Garner. Henry, when he tells is His wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she only sees the mistakes in Henry. <br /> Typical example: Although he has worked up, Tom becomes more and more anti-work in his later years. Trade unions are troublemakers, and he does not care about being slowed down by her Senanigans. Henry describes Tom's confrontation with the Union in a great walk, and how he dealt with it to the detriment of his home life. But Henry's wife reminds him of how Tom used cripples and violence to end the strike (seemingly blow up the Union headquarters - killing many people).So we have two views about the man, but one is pure white and one is pure black. <br />I don't really knock THE POWER AND THE GLORY because I don't duplicate KANE's success (few movies do that - also all the other films by Orson Welles), but I'm aware that the story is presented well enough to keep the interest to the end. Moore as his wife Sally, the tragedy of the couple's worldly success is fully brought home. <br /><br />When they get married, Tom wants to do well (partly) to his wife and family the benefits he never had. But in America's great business success comes at a price. Tom engages deeply with the operation of the railroad empire (he expands it and constantly improves it). But it takes him away from home too much, and he loses contact with Sally. And he also notices Eve (Helen Vinson), the younger woman who When Sally learns of his unfaithful behavior, it destroys her. Similarly, Tom also gets a full shock (which makes him a martyr in the eyes of Henry). Eva marries Tom and introduces him to a son - but it turns out that it is Eve's son of Tom's son Tom Jr. (Philip Trent). The discovery of this incestuous Cuckolds causes Tom to shoot himself. <br />The film is not a total success - the action sometimes jumps unconvincingly. But it makes the business seem real (note the film is not a complete success). Scene when Tom told his board of directors about his plans to buy a small rival train line, and he discussed the use of promissory notes to finance the plans. Sturgis came from a rich background so that he could bring this kind of detail. So on the whole it is a first prize film. No CITIZEN CANE maybe, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt to commercial realism with social comments in Depression America.",positive

"Back to the 36th Chamber is one of those classic Kung Fu films that Shaw produced in the 70s and 80s, whose genre corresponds to the Spaghetti Western Hollywoods, and the protagonist Gordon Liu, the counterpart to the Western Clint Eastwood. Digitally remastered and a new print for the Fantastic Film Fest, which is ""Presented in Shaw Scope"", just like the good old time. <br /> <br />This film is a simple story of good and evil, told in 3 acts, which more or less summarizes the narrative The martial arts films of that time. Act One sets the premise. Workers in a dyeing shop of a small village are unhappy with their lot by lowering their wages by 20% by arriving Manchu gangsters. They can't do much about their exploitation because none of them is skilled in martial arts to take over the gangsters, and their boss. First, they had a small success in getting Liu to imitate a highly qualified Shaolin monk (one of the best comedy sequences), but their uproar was suspended when they pushed. the limit of credibility by imitating one too often. <br /> <br />Act Two shows the protagonist who wants to come back to the mob. But without real martial arts he embarks on a journey to Shaolin Temple to try, infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly. After some slapstick moments, he is finally accepted by the abbot (who he embodied!), but is disappointed about the teaching methods - somehow like Mr. Miyagi's style in Karate Kid, but instead of painting fences, he gets to build fences, he gets Scaffolding around the temple. Nothing can keep a good man down, and he unknowingly builds strength, perseverance and learns kung fu the unorthodox way. <br /> <br />Act Three is where the fight begins. With kitschy sound effects, every obvious contact on film is given the maximum effect treatment. But it's rather refreshing to watch the fighting scenes here, with its far-angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners, and the use of slow motion only stunts in presenting You may find the speed of the fights a bit too slow, with some pause in between the trains, but with Yuen Where Ping and his style ad-Nausem used in Hollywood strips, they certainly won't make battle scenes as they are used to!

"***SPOILERS*** Also in real life as well as in the movie it is known that many young men who are brought with a gun or a rifle into a war zone live in their hands.

With Jimmy's unit tied to a German machine gun nest, he hand-held it out of the commission to bring about half a dozen German soldiers out of the security of a nearby church tower. It was when Jimmy shot down the last surviving German who raised his arms in surrender, that an artillery shell hit the tower seriously injured. <br /><br />Recovery of his wounds in an army hospital Jimmy fell in love with US Army Volunteer nurse Rose Duffy, Gladys George. Rose was really in love with Jimmy's good friend the happy going luck Fred despite his disgusting antique to her.

It was almost by chance that Fred ran Jimmy on the streets of New York City and discovered to his shock and surprise that he had become totally of the meek and nonviolent person he knew before he was sent to war on the European West Front. Smug and sure that he had become, and his ability to shoot a gun, Jimmy A top mobster in New York City's underworld! Not only that, but when Fred found out later that his wife Rose had no idea what Jimmy was really involved with and told her that he was working as a law enforcement and offensive insurance consultant. <br />Jimmy's criminal life came full of circles when, after learning about his secret life, Rose had told him to the police to stop him from committing a ""Valentine Day"" like a massacre with his gang members dressed as cops, his rival mobster. Jimmy came to his senses and admitted his guilt, which was ready to face the music, and then, after his three-year prison term, he got his life back together. <br /> <br />***SPOILER ALERT*** Rumors of fellow convicts hearing that Rose and his best friend Fred had an affair behind his back Jimmy broke out of prison and ended up a fugitive from the law. It's in Fred's circus where he worked as a nativity scene and barker that Jimmy saw that Rose and Fred were faithful to him that he had, as in his trial, But the thought of going back to prison, with at least another ten years of his punishment, was just too much for Jimmy!

"The 33 percent of the nations that W. Bush still support would do well to see this film showing the aftermath of the French Revolution and the terror of 1794 as strikingly similar to the post 9/11 socio-political landscape. Perhaps they could then stop worrying about saving the face and taking what they deserve. It is really a shame that if a politician ruins the country, those who voted for it cannot be denied the right to ever vote again. They have clearly shown that they have no sense of character. <br /> <br />What really stands out in this film is the ambiguity of such a hopelessly doctrinal character as Robespierre; a haunting, empty man who cannot help the simplistic reductive ideology to clarify the boundaries between security and totalitarianism. Execution and murder. Self-defense and patriotism. His legalistic litmus tests worsen the hopeless situation he created. Sounds like all martial, overprivileged, retarded Yale cheerleaders you know? <br /> <br /> <br /> The Slovenian deparidieu is blown up by the screen.

"As someone has already mentioned on this board, it is very difficult to make a fake documentation. It requires enormous skill, speed, patience, directorial 'distance', a plausible premise, a narrative 'river' and truly credible action (aka GREAT Acting). <br />This is not the case with 'Love Machine'. It begins to show its faux hand over the 20-minute mark (still to be seen at 60 minutes), and the viewer begins to realize that he or she is being recorded. It is downhill from there. <br /> <br /> <br Director Gordon Eriksen just came to the climax too early. But to be fair to Eriksen, his problems began early: As he explains in the extras, he wanted to make a REAL doctoral candidate, could not get funding and let himself be chosen for a cheaper way to shoot his film. <br />The premise -- people who have secret lives by publishing on a porn site -- was perhaps more interesting in 1997-98 than the movie was made. Eriksen does a lot of tricky stuff -- a pushy 'guest', hand cameras, zooms, grainy black and white The film is confusing and forced, but what finally crushes it is the credibility of the actors and the rather terrible dialogue.",negative
"The Hills Have Eyes II is what you would expect and nothing more.

"NO SPOILERS!! <br />After Hitchcock's successful first American film, Rebecca, based on Daphne DuMarier's sumptuous novel of gothic romance and intrigue, he returned to some of the more familiar themes of his early British era - false identity and espionage. When the US settled in World War II and the large-scale ""war efforts"" of civilians who built planes, weapons and other necessary militias, the booming film entertainment business began to become paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war. These thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and experienced operators working in the shadows among the good, law-abiding citizens. Knowing that the director was at home in this espionage genre, producer Jack Skirball approached Hitchcock via the management of a property he owned, which dealt with corruption, war-time sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of chance and false identity. The darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of the literary Maven Dorothy Parker (during their Short stint in Hollywood before returning to her Bohemian roots in NYC, who co-authorized the script, perfectly matched Hitchcock's sensibilities. <br /> <br />This often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25-year-old Barry Kane (Robert Cummings), who meets the new employee Frank Frye (Norman Lloyd) during his work in a Los Angeles Airplane Factory and is framed for sabotage a few moments later. his trip to Soda City Utah and finally New York City. These memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful 'freaks' and a popular poster model Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane), who falls madly in love with him during the worst crisis of his life as well as national security! Of course, in the land of Hitchcock, Patricia, kidnapped by the alleged saboteur Barry, falls into her captor and thus adds romantic tension to the mixture. a national network of demented old ladies, average Joes and respectable businessmen who double as secret agent terrorists, who shelter criminals, pull weapons, and bombs to keep things moving. It's a great act that takes its time to move forward and once ignited, culminates in one of Hitchcock's more memorable finals. Look for incredible lives like NYC tourist attractions (all re-created by art directors in Hollywood through the wartime ""shoot ban"" of public attractions). Saboteur may not be one of Hitchcock's most famous movies, it's a popular B-movie, which is certainly solid and engaged with many clever plot twists and as usual - great Hitchcock villains. Remember to look for Hitchcock's Cameo appearance in front of a drug store in the second half of the movie. Hitchcock's original Cameo idea, which was shot (he fought in sign language with his ""dead"" wife) was from the Bureau of Standards and Practices that were afraid to offend the pigeons!",positive
"I just saw The Dresser tonight, after I first saw it, about a dozen years ago. <br />It's not a ""big"" movie, and doesn't try to make a big splash, but my God, the brilliance of the two leads just leaves me speechless. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie. <br /> <br />The dresser is the story of Sir, an aging Shakespearean actor (Finney), and his dresser Norman (Courtenay), a kind of Valet that produces a production of King Lear during the Blitz of London in World War II. These are two men who each depend on the other: Sir is almost helpless without the help of Norman to cajole, wheelle, and tyrannize him on stage for his 227th performance of Lear. And Norman lives his life on behalf of Sir; without needing Sir, he is nothing, or thinks he is, anyway. <br />This is a character driven film; the plot is next to the interaction of the characters, and as such, it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life. life. Finney, only 47 years old, is completely credible as very old, very ill, petulant, bullying, but brilliant stage actor. He hisssss and smokes among his fellow actors even if they take their bows! And Courtenay is no less convincing than the minting dresser, which sometimes has to act more as a mother than a servant of his older employer. Employers are really the wrong term to use, although technically their relationship is that of the employer and employee, most of the time Sir and Norman act like nothing other than an old couple. Yes, there are others in the cast of this movie, but there is no question that the real stars are Finney, Courtenay, and the wonderful script by Ronald Harwood. That's not to say that there are no other beautiful performances, especially Eileen Atkins as the long suffering stage manager Madge. There is a wonderful scene in which Sir and Madge about old desires, old regrets, and what could be. Over these days, it's worth remembering that The Dresser was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Actors Nominations for Finney and Courtenay, Best Picture, Best Director (Peter Yates) and Best Adapted Screenplay. <br />I had remembered that this was a good movie, but I wasn't ready to be as completely astonished as I was from start to finish. If you want to see an example of what big acting is, and entertain very much all the time, then I encourage you to see The Dresser.",positive
"What happened? What we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented actor, but somewhere the movie loses. Actually, it never really went off. There was a little excitement when we find out that Angie isn't really pregnant, then find out that she's after everything, but that was it. Steve Martin, a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie, was terrible and his entire character wasn't even close to this movie important, except to make I really would like to have more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe not try for a pure comedy that was unfortunately not, but maybe a drama with comedian elements.

"DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING is one of Fulci's earlier (and frankly, in terms of story line, better...) movies - and although not the typical ""blood bath"", for which Fulci is known - this is still a very unique and enjoyable movie. <br />The story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders take place. Some of the colorful characters involved in the investigation - either as suspects, or those who ""help"" the investigation (or in some cases both) - belong to the city police, a small Reporter, a beautiful and rich ex-drug addict, a young priest and his mother, an old man who practices witchcraft and his female protégé, a mentally disabled city dweller and a deaf/tumble little girl. All these people are interwoven in the plot to create multiple spins and spins until the actual killer is revealed... <br /><br />DON'TTORTURE A DUCKLING is neither a ""classic"" Giallo nor a typical Fulci Gore movie.

This is a well-written movie with many spins that kept me guessing to the end. Recommended for Giallo/Mord Mystery fans, or anyone who would review some of Fulci's non-platter movies - but don't despair, DON'T TORTURE has even more than it is fairer share of violence and sleaze.

I have no idea why this movie has so much hype around it other than the subject - but to be honest, the necrophilia scenes in movies like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q are, among other things, more shocking than in AFTERMATH.

It's not so shocking, it's not so disgusting. if you insist on seeing it - rent it.

"I thought that Mukhsin was wonderfully written. It's not just about entertainment. There are tons of subtle messages that I think Yasmin is trying to bring over. And yes, it could be confusing for some of you (especially if you don't watch Sepet and/or Gubra for 76 times). <br /> <br /> I bet u noticed how she signs from the two movies to the right? It's really ironic how the characters relate. As the boss neighbor is that prostitute from Gubra. And the chicks on the snooker pad turns out to be around be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future. <br />And I absolutely love the voice-overs. His raw but awakening fresh. When she took a shot from the Rumah Tumpangan Gamin shield, then there was suddenly Mukhsin's voice say 'Bismilahhirrahmannirrahim.' (the scene when he climbed the tree). <br /> <br />It conquers Malaysian's attitude (and in a mild way, snarling as it is) represented in the figure. For example, even the children can be really sharp. And how one can be such a busy body and talk about ppl if one's own life is not sorted out. <br /> <br />All I can say is that this film has completely reached my expectation if it has not exceeded it. <br /> <br /> He kept me glued to the screen, I couldn't even take my eyes off it. Don't even make out in the movies. Ha ha.",positive
"I'm not a golf fan by no means. On May 26 at around 10:30 p.m. the film began with a scene in the late 1800s. Old movies I like, but not golf, however, within the first scene a young boy (Harry Vardon) is awakened by the voices of the men. He goes outside to ask what they do and is told them that they build a golf something... So, then I turned off the TV, but something moved me and it was on again. The movie is excellent. We see this young boy now a man; professional golfer who is Then we make the true focus of the movie Francis and the decisions he makes for Golf. They make his mother and father who want to protect him from the class thing that is so obvious during the period. Then there's little Eddie Lowery his caddy with encouraging words and little pushes that are instrumental at Francis winning. Don't want to give away too much. I was up to 2 A.M.

"Looking at Tobe Hooper's jewel, Crocodile, in 2000, I developed a great interest in the college/Crocodile niche of exploitation/ Monster genre. I am looking forward to a devious producer, with several sequels, to follow these delightful candies of camp quality. If only Ed Wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts. With Ed writing the scripts, and a room full of monks creating crocodile special effects on a computer, all we would need would be an occupation of croky food with Russ Meyer breasts and Ren Hoek breast implants. <br />While Tobe Hooper's crooked opus referenced his own movies, Blood Surf decided to release a number of aging themes from the Chum bucket of other movies. See if you can stop by the Revenge of the Nerds sequel sets to find the allusions/homages?/Rip-offs to Jaws, Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones' Last Crusade, The Convent, Godzilla 2000 and any James Bond movie. Also try to find the ready-for-TV fade where the editor gave up to make sense. the stock. <br /> <br />I was disappointed that the crok did not get to his sotto voce tenor with a soloquy about environment...or croky acknowledgment try, but the quasi-captain Ahab of history gets his tour de force spoke. Perhaps, in the coming years, we will see a crok galloping after a shooting into a golden sunset. Or hopefully, a monkey flush a croky to the toilet of an international space station for dwarfs and enjoy the exploitative waltz of Zero-G monkey/midget/crocodile Bloodshed. <br /> <br />All-in-all, the lack of a Whammy bar in surf music has irritated me.",negative
"It tries to be the epic adventure of the century. And with an cast like Shô Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies, it's really the perfect B adventure of all time. It's actually a pretty funny, sloppy adventure that captures your interest, even with its mistakes. It must have felt like the biggest movie ever for the people who made it. Even if it's done in the 90s, it doesn't have a modern feeling. It has more the same feeling that an old Errol Flynn movie had. The thing in Hollywood, but I'm afraid the feeling in them will never be the same as those old movies. This on the other hand, just has the real feeling. You just can't hate it. I think it's an okay adventure movie. And I love the soundtrack. Damn, I want the theme song.",positive
"The last hard men find James Coburn an outlaw who frees a long sentence from a chain. Lead him and his friends the Mexican border out of prison and out of security. No, they don't because Coburn has a mission of revenge. To kill the peace officer who brought him in and killed his wife. <br /> This peace officer is Charlton Heston, who is now retired and he knows what Coburn is after. As he explains to his daughter Barbara Hershey, Coburn was buried in a hut and was It's not something he's proud of, she was a collateral victim in a manhunt. <br /> <br />We're sorry for Coburn, he lets us know what a bad man he really is. Heston is his usual stalwart hero, but the acting honors in The Last Hard Men go to James Coburn. He blows everyone else off the screen when he's on. <br /><br />Coburn gets the bright idea to make sure Heston chases him by hijacking Hershey. He knows that Heston will have to do it personally. Coburn's gang includes Morgan Paull, Thalmus Rasulala, John Quade, Larry Wilcox and Jorge Rivero. Heston has Chris Mitchum, who is his son-in-law. <br />The Last Hard Men is a nasty and brutal Western. Andrew McLaglen steered it and I think it might have been a project originally intended for Sam Peckinpaugh. It certainly shows a lot of his Influence with the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate the violence. There is a lot of that. <br /> <br />For a little Peckinpaugh lite, The Last Hard Men is your movie.",positive
"Maybe it was the title, or the trailer (certainly not the interview on the DVD, that's with the director, as he keeps saying ""hi, kids"" in the camera like a buffoon), but I had expectations of being Entrails of a Virgin at least a bit sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal, bloody murders from a strange Japanese penetrator. Turns out it's way too sleazy for his own good, or bad, or whatever. There's a problem- and you can do that even in the Italian sex plot strip porn Holocaust, Similar to in many ways - in the not balance to sex and violence. Too much sex and it becomes a prototypical porn, and not even with a lot of production quality compared to most professional porn films! And with the killing scenes, there must be at least a little tack, and perhaps just a smid of ingenuity, in creating the creature / killer / whatever. Entrails of a Virgin has none. It's sure to say it's a pretty soulless movie, even if not one of the worst ever made- It's just for horn-dog Japanese fetishists to go to girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their ""other"" heads. <br /> <br />In this case we get a photo team where the guys take some shots of some girls, nothing too kind, and then through a dense fog they stay away in a house one night and are credited by one after the other by ""A Murderer"", as he is. First of all, the director Kazuo 'Gaira' Komizu decides he must put up in a quota of random sex scenes early on- we get It looks like it's from another movie. Then, as once admitted into the house, there is a 'wrestling' scene that is badly choreographed and shot (yes, we really need to see him 'all' there), and then on the rape and murders. First the rape, by the photographers who promise the girls some jobs for their time. Then the killer, the D'Amato's creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial treatment, and who for an unknown reason kills the men and/or rapes the women one by one. <br /> Well, the latter, taken from themselves, should be considered the highlights of the movie. This is as if to say that the croûtons are the best part of a miserable tasting salad. A winking scene, a lace thrown like an Olympic event (this scene is actually kind of cool), and finally the entrails of the overly sex-drenched girl whose inconspicuous name I can't *This* is also disappointing just because it doesn't fit the title properly! In addition, the sex scenes that are flooded by 'Gaira' and his estate in long take-without-cutaways, where everything is blurry by the Japanese censors anyway, are flooded by the actors (you would think that they're having enough fun, therefore the need to 'speak' them for themselves). But the overall feeling of Entrails of a Virgin is that of a clumsy one where it's just there to be Gawked up and without a shred of tension or true horror (awakening as the last girl left alive, the virgin of the image, trying to stop the killer to her, which lasts five minutes as she throws sticks at him!) They just want to be done with it, for the ""I hate women"" mantra to ease or get rid of it altogether.",negative
"The few scenes that actually try to portray the revolutionary struggle resemble a hilarious scout force that meanders timidly between swimming holes. If Sharif or, thank God, Palance try their hand at fiery oratorio, they sound like Kurtz, who devours a beetle. The depictions of strategic brilliance include a map of Cuba with smiling fish in the ocean, and a positive Vaudevilian hypothesis of how the Bay of Pigs happened. What does that leave us? Remarkable Hollywood farmers who appeal to the camera as if it were a move that moves, and, just for kicks, a passel of homoerotics that is not limited to Castro's manic and unyielding cigar patio. Never trust a Medved, but even a broken watch is true twice a day: this is a HISTORYT terrible movie.",negative
"This movie surprised me. I make it my habit to find out as little as possible about movies before the visit because trailers and reviews offer spoilers to Spoiler. All I knew when I entered the theater is that it was a documentary about a long couple and that IMDb readers there was a 7.8, Rotten Tomatoe's user ranks it at 7.9 and the critics average an amazing 8.2! If anything, they COMMITTED this little gem. <br />Filmmaker Doug Block decided to record his parents ""for posterity"" and at the beginning of the film we will be treated with the necessary interviews with his parents, pronounced mother Mina, and less than coming father, Mike. I immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker (Mike & Mina's son Doug) would take us. Indeed, I doubt that Doug himself knew where he was going with it! <br /> <br /> <br /> Life takes unexpected turns and turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey. It is difficult to verbalize how I was with this story and the unique way it was told. Absolutely captivating from beginning to end and it's really a must, even if you're not a fan of the documentary genre. This movie will make you think of your own life and could even evoke memories that you thought long forgotten. ""51 Birch Street"" is one of those rare cinematic experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you. The best news of all is that HBO had a hand in the production so instead of playing a limited Kunsthaus audience, after all, millions of people have the chance to see this incredible piece of work.

Everyone at some point or other during a really intense height comes to a moment when they think they have the universe and the cosmos And they swear, as soon as they're sober, they write it all down. Well, here's a man who actually held this feeling for more than six hours. Here's a man who, despite the suffering of Lou Gehrig's illness, has become the greatest spirit the world has seen.

I've seen more impressive effects at Disneyland, I've seen better performances at a school game, And I've seen more convincing crocodiles in the zoo where they're doing nothing but sitting in the water and ignoring the children knocking on the glass. <br /> The story is located in northern Australia. Ambitious young people, try a new water sports, surfing in shark-filled waters. It soon becomes obvious that something is more dangerous in the water. After they learn what, they get the help of a Grizzly middle-aged fisherman who wants to kill the animal to avenge the food of his family. <br /> <br />I think I've seen every crocodile movie made in the last fifteen years, the best of which is Lake Placid, and the worst of it is its sequel. Blood Surf should be the second-limmest crocodile Flick, I think, with Primeval and crocodile close after you. <br />The Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there, resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths per year. Films like Blood Surf, however, ruin not only the cruel image of such a creature, but a good hour and a half of the viewer's life. If you don't really want to see it, avoid Blood Surf.",negative
"""Fate"" leads Walter Sparrow to come into possession of a mysterious novel that has uncanny similarities and connections to his life, all based on number 23. While the story unfolds in real life and fiction, Sparrow has to find out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end. <br /><br />The number 23 offers a fascinating premise that is nullified by a weak execution. The film just failed on many different levels, which is quite disappointing because it had so much potential. The script was probably the worst of it. It was full of silly sequences and ridiculous dialogues that just killed the mood of the movie. It seemed as if the screenwriter had a good idea, he just didn't know how to develop it to run for over ninety minutes. The second half of the movie ran on ideas, the turn was pretty obvious and the end was terrible. <br /> <br />Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he solved himself a little with Phone. Booth and a few other movies, but The Number 23 reminds me that he's still able to make a stinker. He's sunk the movie in a way, but he just can't get a good focus. He moves the movie at a clumsy and slow pace. He changes from reality to what actually happens in the book, which quickly got annoying. The actual book in the movie, that is, ""The Number 23"" is a terrible detective story and the audience gets stuck in listening to Carrey, which only bores me to tears. We wait impatiently for the film to come to a terrible end and an unsurpassable explanation before we celebrate that the film is finally over. <br /> The acting was mostly average and rather forgetful. Jim Carrey was clearly only sleepwalking through his performance and he didn't even seem to try it. He was either completely above the top in Some scenes or just very wood. His story was a complete long to listen to and he did not put life in his character. Virginia Madsen did the best she could with a limited role, but she had to choose better scripts. Logan Lerman was pretty bland like Danny Huston. Overall, the number 23 was a terrible thriller that offered more laugh than tension or thrill.",negative

"This is a typical Steele-Roman production in which two people who have been through a kind of tragedy come together despite all the odds.

Everyone becomes friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love. <br /> <br /> Two leads aren't big, even though the talent of these two people, in my opinion, is not a question. They did the best they could, with a predictable plot and a script bordering stereotypical boundaries. Two people meet, tragedy, greater tragedy, a secret is revealed, another tragedy, and then they come together.

"Hollywood film industry is the most lazy in the world. It just needs a single hit to re-invent theater with the same old crap and time and again. Take superheroes for example for each X-Man and Spiderman, there are Daredevil, Elektra, Ghost Rider and Hulk. Japanese horror remakes are even worst. It only took the ring that was pitch-perfect (especially because of Mr. Gore Verbinsky), to look a ton alike creepy-woman based horrors, e.g. The Ring 2, The Eye, Dark Water (that was Good, but pointless), and the grudge. <br /> <br />The first grudge was not quite bad. It was most frightening what could be expected of him. Besides, the plot had some brains that mixed narratives. Groll 2 is just like the previous; that could be a good thing, but hey, what kind of young men in Black II? Was it a nice thing xerox the whole script and just change the villain? For the grudge 2, the critic goes the same way. <br /> There are Aubrey (Tamblyn) who investigates what her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) has driven to death; Allison (Arielle Kebbel) who is taken away by colleagues to visit the house where the incident took place in the first movie; and finally, an American family who experience strange things in the apartment next door. I am pleased to say (and I mean it) that everything is tied up in the end, but one must not focus on the End to make a good picture when everything else is just tiring and boring. <br />The chills are everywhere there, a girl alone in the lockers, someone who shouldn't go into a house, others who dig too deep. Meanwhile, ghosts continue to kill and kill and kill, which seems even more deadly than ten world wars or the Ebola epidemic.

It's also Ray Milland, Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, John King, Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady. It's a sweet story about three young women who now live in Switzerland with their divorced mother who hear their father (Winninger) get married again. The help of the housekeeper/children's wife, determined to stop the wedding. As she is aware that the intended, ""Precious"" (Barnes) is called, is nothing more than a gold graver supported by her mother (Brady), they arrange that she be presented to a wealthy count. This is arranged by the accountant of her father (King). The man he chooses is a full-time drink (Auer), but the girls confuse him with an actual wealthy count (Milland). What a mess. some nice performances, especially from Auer, Milland, Barnes and Brady. The young women are pretty and all do good work. Of course, the focus is on the young Durbin, who is a natural actress and a beautifully trained singer. In fact, her voice as a teenager is much more even than it would be as an adult - she has no problems with the high tones as she later did because she has too much weight in the middle voice. She sings a delightful ""Il Bacio"" in a police station. Things about the movie is to see the father, played by Charles Winninger, does not want his children around - until he sees them and meets them. Barnes as a gold digner is not quite so young, but the mother of the girls looks up high, so the conclusion was probably the older man who is looking for his youth with a younger, more glamorous woman. In fact he finds the youth he was looking for in his daughters. <br /> <br />Universal gives Durbin the great star building here - she has the last shot in the movie. Ray Milland at This point was still his merit, and it will probably also be a surprise for movie fans how young and attractive he is. <br /> <br />Very entertaining and of course this led to a sequel and great stardom for Deanna.",positive

Upon arrival in Peach's castle, Mario Bowser finds his son (Bowser Jr.) and attacks the castle with her airships. Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and then lifts her castle into space. In the middle of the castle is raised up in the room Mario falls down and lands on an unknown planet. Mario is found by a talking star named Luma and is returned to the Luma's home, a floating space station, here Mario meets many other lumas and also meets her guide, a woman named Rosalina. Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser has taken away the space station Power Stars and scattered them across the universe, it is up to Mario to help the lumas find them and save Peach, so begins the adventure. <br />The way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies, each galaxy consists of several planets that Mario travels below in levels over these Shooting stars to retrieve the Power Stars. Mario can go at many times all the way to lose planets without gravity, some planets are small and others are large, many planets are similar to classic Mario environments. The best thing about the game are the controls, all things like jumping and such is still the same, but the Wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game. They shake the distant Mario leads a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game, and it will also activate You can also point the remote control to the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits on enemies or objects in the area. Then there is the graphics, these are by far the best graphics on the Wii, it's only so hard to describe how big this game looks, you could probably say it looks as good as some 360 games. <br /> <br />My only little handles is that the moving up effect takes some getting used to, and even the story is pretty weak. The worst is that you lose all of your life when you turn off the game, no matter how many you had, when you last stopped rebooting at 4 lives. Despite these little problems, it's a great game that's very entertaining and very challenging. This is the kind of game we've been waiting for on the Wii. <br /> <br />A perfect 10 out of 10!",positive
"One of the other critics has mentioned that after seeing only 1 episode of Oz that is going to be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened to me.<br /br />The first thing that caught my attention about Oz was his brutality and unbreakable scenes of violence, which were established from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for those with a weak or shy heart.This show does not throw blows with respect to drugs, sex or violence.It is hard, in the classic use of the word.<br /br />It is called oz as it is the nickname given to the Prison of the State of Maximum Security of Oswald. It focuses mainly on the Esmeralda City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not the most important thing on the agenda. Em City is home to many.. Aryans, Muslims, gangsters, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more.... so the pitfalls, death looks, dubious deals and shady deals are never far away.<br /br /> I would say that the main attraction of the show is due to the fact that it goes where it goes Other programs wouldn’t dare. Forget the pretty pictures painted for the general public, forget the charm, forget the romance...OZ doesn’t play around. The first episode I saw hit me as unpleasant as it was surrealist, I couldn’t say I was ready for it, but as I saw more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got used to the high levels of graphic violence. Not only violence, but injustice (sniffed guards that will be sold by a nickel, inmates who will kill by order and get away with it, well educated, middle class prisoners who become prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you can feel comfortable with what it is to see uncomfortable....that if you can contact your darker side.",positive
"A small and wonderful production. <br /br />The technique of filming is very simple- very old-BBC fashion and gives a comforting feeling, and sometimes uncomfortable, of realism to the whole piece. <br /br />The actors are extremely well chosen- Michael Sheen not only ""has gotten all the polari"" but has all the voices down patted also! You can actually see the seamless edition guided by references to the entries in Williams' diary, not only worth the observation, but it is an excellently written and A masterful production of one of the great masters of comedy and its life. Realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard who, instead of using the traditional techniques of ""dream"" remains solid then disappears. Play in our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes related to Orton and Halliwell and the decorations (particularly from his floor with the murals of Halliwell decorate each surface) are terribly well done.",positive
"I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a summer weekend too hot, sitting in the air-conditioned theater and watching a cheerful comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is ingenious and the characters are nice (even the good bread suspicious of serial killer). While some may be disappointed when they realize that this is not the point of match 2: Addicting to risk, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still totally in control of the style that many of us have grown to love. Most of me had laughed at one of Woody's comedies in years (I say a decade?).Although I've never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson, in this he managed to tone down his ""sexy"" image and jumped right into an average young woman, but animated.This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was more ingenious than ""Devil Wears Prada"" and more interesting than ""Superman"" a great comedy to go see with friends.",positive

"Petter Mattei's ""Love in the Time of Money"" is a visually impressive film to watch. Mr Mattei offers us a vivid portrait of human relationships. This is a film that seems to be telling us what money, power and success make people in the different situations we encounter. <br /br />This is a variation of Arthur Schnitzler's work on the same subject, the director transfers action to the present-day New York era where all these different characters meet and connect. , or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. In style, the film has a sophisticated aspect of luxury. They lead us to see how these people live and the world that live in their own habitat. <br /br /> The only thing that one pulls out of all these souls in the image are the different stages of solitude that each one inhabits.A great city is not exactly the best place where human relations find sincere fulfillment, as it is discerned is the case with most people. The performance is good under the direction of Mr. Mattei. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Empireli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come to life. We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and look forward to his next work.",positive
"Probably my favorite film of all time, a story of disinterest, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it is neither preaching nor boring. It simply never ages, despite having seen it about 15 or more times in the last 25 years. Paul Lukas' performance brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of his few truly sympathetic roles, is a delight. Children are, as Grandma says, more like ""dwarfs dressed"" than children, but that only makes them more fun to watch. What is happening in the world and under its own roof is believable and surprising. If I had a dozen thumbs, everyone would be ""up"" for this movie.",positive

"This show was an incredible, fresh and innovative idea in the 1970s when it was first aired. The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but things fell after that. In 1990, the show was no longer really fun, and has continued its decline beyond the complete loss of time it is today. <br /br />It is really embarrassing how far this show has fallen. Writing is painfully bad, the performances are almost so bad - if not for the slightly entertaining respite of the guests-hosts, this show would probably not be I find it so difficult to believe that the same creator who chose the original cast by hand also chose the hack band that followed. How can you recognize such brilliance and then consider it appropriate to replace it with such mediocrity? I felt that I should give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show a great success. As it is now, the show is simply horrible. I cannot believe it is still in the air.",negative
"Encouraged by the positive comments about this movie here I was looking forward to watching this movie. Bad mistake. I have seen more than 950 movies and this is really one of the worst of them - it is horrible in almost every way: editing, rhythm, history, 'act' soundtrack (the only song in the movie - a lame country song - is played no less than four times). The film looks cheap and unpleasant and is boring at the end. I have rarely been so happy to see the final credits of a movie. < br /br /> It gives me a score of 1 is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from his best performance that at least seems to be doing a little bit of an effort.

"Phil the Alien is one of those extravagant movies where humor is based on the rarity of everything instead of the real jokes.<br /br />At first it was very strange and quite funny, but as the film progressed it no longer found the jokes or funny raritys.<br /br />It is a low budget movie (that is never a problem in itself), there were some quite interesting characters, but finally I lost interest.<br /br /> I imagine this film would be attractive to a stoner who is currently participating.<br /br /> For something similar but better try ""Brother of another planet""",negative
"I watched this movie when I was about 12 when it came out. I remember the scariest scene was the big bird eating men hanging powerless parachutes from the air. Horror. Horror. Like a child going to these cheesy B movies on Saturday afternoon, I was still tired of the formula for these monster-like movies that usually included the hero, a beautiful woman who could be a teacher’s daughter and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end. I didn’t care much about the Romantic angle like a 12-year-old and predictable plots. I love it now for unintentional humor. <br /br />But, about a year later, I saw Psycho when he came out and I loved that the star, Janet Leigh, was hit out early in the movie. I sat down and took note at that point. Since the writers are making up the story, making it as scary as possible and not a well-timed formula. There are no rules.",negative
"So I'm not a big fan of Boll's work, but again not many are. I enjoyed his movie Postal (maybe im the only). Boll apparently bought the rights to use Far Cry a long time ago, even before the game itself was even finished. < br /br /> People who have enjoyed killing mercenaries and infiltrating secret research laboratories located on a tropical island should be warned, that this is not Far Cry... This is something Mr. Boll has plotted along with his schmucks legion.. three of his compatriots to play with. These players go by the names of Til Schweiger, Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller.<br /br />Three names that have actually made themselves quite big in the movie business. So the story goes like this, Jack Carver played by Til Schweiger (yes Carver is German everyone hails the bratwurst eating guys!) However I think that Tils acting in this movie is pretty rough.. People have complained about how he doesn't really keep true to Carver's entire agenda, but we only saw the carver in a First person perspective so that we don't really know what it looked like when I was kicking a**.. <br /br /> However, the story in this movie is beyond insane. We see the evil mad scientist Dr. Krieger played by Udo Kier, making genetically mutated soldiers or GMS as they are called. Perform his top secret investigation on an island that reminds me of ""SPOILER"" Vancouver for some reason. That there are no palm trees here. Instead we have some good rich loggers. started CRY (mehehe) I can't move on.. If you want to be true to Bolls shenanigans then go see this movie that won't disappoint you that offers the real Boll experience, which means that most of it will suck.<br/br/>There are some things worth mentioning that would imply that Boll did a good job in some areas of the film, such as a good boat and fighting scenes.Until the entire Chromed/Albino GMS team enters the scene and all makes me laugh..

What I do know is that a certain Rev Bowdler (hence the ruse) tried to do something similar in the Victorian era. <br /br />In other words, you can't improve perfection. <br /br />I have no more to write, but as I have to write at least ten text lines (and the English composition was never my fort, I'll just have to go ahead and say that this movie, as the saying goes, just doesn't cut it.",negative

"Something drawn by erotic scenes, just to realize that this was one of the most amateur and amazing films I've ever seen. Something like a high school film project. What was Rosanna Arquette thinking? And what was there with all those characters in that strange so-called Midwest town? Pretty hard to get involved with this one. There are no lessons to learn from it, without brilliant ideas, just sluggish and pretty ridiculous (but a lot of skin, if that intrigues you) in meaningless video.... The bisexual relationship, out of nowhere, after all the heterosexual encounters. And what was with that absurd dance, with everyone playing their stereotyped roles? Giving this one a pass, it’s like a million other miles of bad, wasted film, money that could have been spent on hungry children or AIDS in Africa....",negative
"Some films simply should not be remade. This is one of them. In and by itself it is not a bad movie. But it fails to capture the flavor and terror of the 1963 movie of the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as it always is, and most of the cast stands, with the exception of Owen Wilson, who simply did not bring the right feeling to Luke’s character. But the biggest flaw with this version is that he deviated too far from Shirley Jackson’s story in his attempts to be great and lost some of the the emotion of the previous movie in a more dazzling special effects exchange. Again I will say that in itself it is not a bad movie. But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.",positive
"This movie became one of my 10 most horrible movies. Horrible. There was no continuous minute in which there was no fight with one monster or another. There was no possibility of any character development, they were too busy running from one sword fight to another. I had no emotional attachment (except for the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them) The scenes were blatantly stolen from other films, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. The end was stolen from the final scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda, Obee One and Vader. <br /br />>The spider machine in the beginning was exactly like Frodo being attacked by the spider in Return of the Kings. (Elijah Wood is the victim in both films) and waiting......hissnotizes his victim and wraps them up.....uh hello??????????br /br />>And the whole machine vs. humans theme WAS the Matrix... or Terminator.... <br /br />There are more examples but why waste time? What was there with the Nazis?!?! Nazi??????? <br /br /> There was a youthful story of the line rushed to a youthful conclusion.

"A horrible movie! It must have been against some real stinkers to be nominated for the Golden Globe. They have taken the story of the first famous Renaissance painter and spoiled it beyond recognition. My complaint is not that they have taken liberties with the facts; if the story were good, that would be perfectly fine. But it is simply strange -- according to all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a much better movie, so why did they come up with this dashwater-dull script? There were not enough naked people in the factual version. In the end, with a summary of the artist's life, we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they had favored the rest of the film with the same brevity.",negative
"After the success of Die Hard and his sequels it is no surprise that in the 1990s, an excess of 'Die Hard on a .....' films were charged on the wrong guy, wrong place, concept of wrong time. That's what they did with Cliffhanger, Die Hard on a mountain just in time to rescue the career of Sly 'Stop or My Mom Will Shoot' Stallone.<br /br />Cliffhanger is a great dream of nit-pickers, especially for those who are experts in mountain climbing, base jumps, aviation, facial expressions, acting skills. full of excuses to discard the film as a lot of exaggerated rubbish. Stallone even managed to be overcome by a horse! However, if you forget all the nonsense, it is actually a very adorable and certainly entertaining ronp that offers a lot of emotions, and unintentionally, a lot of laughter.<br /br /> You have to love John Lithgows bold evil, his tick every band of bad boxes, and best of all, the permanently harassed and deventured agent, Rex Linn as Travers.<br /br /> He has been Henry in ""Portrait of a Serial Killer,"" but Michael Rooker is notable for a cringe-worthy performance like Hal, insists on constantly shouting in painful disbelief to his captors ""that man never hurt anyone"" And although he surely can't be, it really seems that Ralph Waite's character Frank is smiling as the girl plummets to his death. Yeah, you can't help but enjoy that part, Hal needed a good kick.So forget your best judgment, who cares if 'that could never happen', lower your performance expectations, turn up the volume and enjoy!

Because it fails in all aspects that make a good movie: the story is not interesting at all, all actors are of fine paper and not at all credible, it has bad direction and the sequences of action are so false that it is almost fun....... almost.<br /br /> The movie is full of a line of shit that no respectable person could find entertaining at least a little.<br /br /> This movie is supposed to be aimed at men, but all the women in it are so absolutely unappealing, especially that wrinkled old thing that comes to the end.

"First, let's clarify some things here: a) I'm an anime fan - it's always been in fact (I used to watch Speed Racer all the time in preschool). b) I like several B-Movies movies because they're hilarious. c) I really like Godzilla movies. It's really bad and cheap, even worse than I remember from SPEED RACER, for chrissakes! In fact, it's so cheap, one of the few scenes in the movie that ""lively"" I remember is when a lot of kids run out of school... and it's the same kids over and over again! The FXs are terrible, too; the dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. Also, the transition to live action to animation is not organized, the dialogue and voices (especially the English dub I saw) was horrible and I was asking my father to pull out the tape The only thing that made me survive was making jokes and comments like robots and Joel/Mike at MST3K (you choose the season). Honestly, this is the only way to enjoy this movie and survive at the same time.<br /br />Heck, I'm planning to show this to another friend of mine otaku on Halloween for a B-Movie night. Because it's stupid, quite painful to see and involuntarily hilarious at the same time, I'm giving this movie a 3/10, an improvement from 0.5/10 I (According to my rating scale: 3/10 means more or less boring and bad. As fun as counting up to three unless you find a way to make fun of it, then it will become as fun as counting up to 15.)",negative
"This was the worst movie I saw in the WorldFest and also received the least number of applauses afterwards! I can only think that you are getting such recognition based on the number of actors known in the movie. It’s great to see J.Beals, but she’s only in the movie for a few minutes. M.Parker is a much better actress than the allowed part for. The rest of the performance is hard to judge because the film is so ridiculous and predictable. The main character is totally unfriendly and therefore boring to watch. A movie that revolves around an actor who can't get a job doesn't feel very original to me. Neither does the development of the police. It feels like one of the many live-to-video movies I saw in the '90s... and not even a good one at those standards.",negative

"""The Cell"" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying journey in not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also in one of a very talented director. This is conclusive proof of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imagination. This is audacity at work, leaving aside thoughts to fall into formulas and clichés and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best film of the year to date. <br /br /> I have read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere in style and This film can be a milestone, a tradition in which we hope that future films will follow. ""The Cell"" just opened the door to another world of imagination. So we can close the door on her face and tell her and her director Tarsem Singh that we don't want any more? Personally, I would like more than to welcome another Tarsem movie, and I would love to see someone try to challenge it. The 1990s were full of films that tried to describe what made serial killers tick-tac; some of them worked, but most failed. But ""The Cell"" does not flame along the same path, we are given a new twist, physically transport us to the mind and present us with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject we have ever studied. Down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez really gets into someone else's brain. Instead, she just lies on a lab table and is wrapped up in what looks really long Twizzlers and makes fun of another entity. ""The Cell"" wants to let ""see"" what it is and not ""how"" it is, and I guess that's what some people don't like. It's true, I like the explanations with my movies, but when a movie ventures into a new field you should let her do what she likes. I noticed that the film was very dark when it showed reality, perhaps to contrast the bright images when it was inside the brain of another. However, the set design was simply amazing. I wouldn’t be surprised if this film took home some Oscars in film, better costumes, better director and the like. If it depended on me, at least it would be nominated for the best image. To say, but because I cannot emphasize how fantastic I thought ""The Cell"" was. If you enter the film with a very open mind and have to take control with wonders and a feast of eyes-popping then you are assured a good time. I guess this film was just a little too much for some people, which is written as ""small"" or ""mad."" I am very much in the psychology and imagination of the human mind, so it was right in my alley. Leaving the theater, I heard a member of the audience say ""Who made that movie"" If so, I want what I was smoking.",positive
"This film tried to be too many things at once: the sharp political satire, the Hollywood blockbuster, the romantic comedy toad, the promotion of family values... the list goes on and on.

There is a criticism to make about the corporatization of war. But mocking it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening.

"The 'war movie' is a Hollywood genre that has been made and remade so many times that cliché dialogue, renewed plot and exaggerated action sequences seem inevitable for any conflict that deals with large-scale fighting. However, from time to time, a war film goes against the grain and brings a truly original and convincing story to life on the silver screen. The 'Fry Mountain' of the Civil War era, starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger is such a movie. Mountain"" a war movie is not entirely accurate. It is true, the film opens with a (very literally) quick and dirty battle sequence that puts ""Glory"" director Edward Zwick shame. However, ""Cold Mountain"" is not so much about the Civil War itself as about the period and the people of the time. The story focuses on the discontented Confederate Inman soldier, played by Jude Law, who dislikes the terrible war and nostalgia for the beautiful village of the Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the Ada Monroe, played by Nicole Kidman. At first glance, this configuration seems formulative, as the romantic interest at home gives the audience enough sympathy to root the tribulations of reluctant soldiers on the battlefield. In fact, the first segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even a little intrigued.<br /br />""Fry Mountain"" soon takes a drastic turn, although, as the fearless hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (almost saving the and begins a long odyssey home. Meanwhile, back on the farm, Ada’s cultured ways prove to be of little use in the fields; soon it becomes something of a wild beast. Arriving at Ada’s rescue there is the course, ruby Thewes, hard as nails, played by Renée Zellweger, who helps Ada to rebuild the farm and, perhaps more importantly, to cope with the loneliness and isolation that the war seems to have caused Within these two scenarios, a vivid, convincing and sometimes very war-torn portrait of the south is developed.The characters with which Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by the wonderful performances of Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's late father, Ray Winstone as an impenitent ""lawman"" of the south, and Natalie Portman as a young mother deeply disturbed and isolated.All have been greatly affected and changed by ""the war of aggression of the north,"" mainly for worse. The dark and penetrating anti-war message, accentuated by an effective and chilling and beautiful takeover of Virginia and North Carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by horrifying battle scenes as by the marked land and traumatized people who fought the war. Although the weapons and tactics of the war itself have changed a lot in the last century, their infernal effect on the earth is always relevant. The story of love between Inman and Ada is clumsily tied to the beginning and end of the film, although the inherently distant, abstract and even absurd nature of its relationship in one way fits the depressing nature of the rest of the plot.Don't be mistaken, ""Fry Mountain"" has neither the traits of a good-feeling romance nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that can not only entertain, but also truly absorb the audience in the life of a people torn by war and totally desperate to get rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.",positive
"Taut and organically exciting, Edward Dmytryk's Crossfire is a distinctive thriller thriller, an unlikely ""message"" film using the look and devices of the noir cycle. <br /br />Bivouacked in Washington, DC, a company of soldiers face their anxiety by hanging out in bars.Three of them end up in a stranger's apartment where Robert Ryan, drunk and belligerent, hits his host (Sam Levene) to death because he happens to be a Jew. Mitchum, who is assigned to Ryan’s team. Suspicion falls on the second of the three (George Cooper), who has disappeared. Ryan kills the third friend (Steve Brodie) to ensure his silence before Young closes on.<br /br /> A instigated by a top script by John Paxton, Dmytryk draws precise performances from his three stars Bobs. Ryan naturally makes his prototypic White Man Angry (and to the hilt), while Mitchum plays with his characteristic alert carelessness (his role, however, is not central); Gloria Grahame gives her first full version of the intelligent and vulnerable bitch, and, like a sad sack that has slept in her life, Paul Kelly pursues us in a small, peripheral role that he makes memorable. The politically engaged Dmytryk may inevitably succumb to lecturing, but it is rather limited to Young's reminiscence of how his Irish grandfather died at the hands of the intolerant a century earlier (by the way, stretching the chronology).

"""Ardh Satya"" is one of the best films ever made in Indian cinema. Directed by great director Govind Nihalani, this is Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema's most successful film that also turned out to be a commercial success. Even today, Ardh Satya is an inspiration to all leading directors in India.<br /br />The film tells the real scenario of Mumbai Police of the 1970s. Unlike any police from other cities in India, Mumbai Police encompasses a different system altogether. Govind Nihalani creates a The film describes the story of Anand Velankar, a young hot-blooded policeman from a poor family. His father is a tough cop. Anand himself suffers from his father’s ideologies and incidences of his father’s atrocities on his mother. Anand’s approach to immediate action against crime is an inert desire for his own job satisfaction. The film is turned here In a plot in which Anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled on by his elders, which leads to frustrations, as he cannot achieve the satisfaction desired by work. As a result of frustrations, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the pretrial prison rooms and bars, also make him an alcoholic.The Spirit within him is still alive, as he constantly fights against the system. He is aware of the subway system, where the police and politicians are an inert associate by far. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand breaks into the house of Underworld gangster Rama Shetty to arrest him, followed by a short conversation that is fantastic. In many scenes, the film has moments of hair increase. The practical approach of Script is a big blow. Alcoholism, Corruption, Political Influence, Courage, Deceptions are an integral part of Mumbai These aspects are treated brilliantly. Finally, the films belong to One Man's show, Om Puri portraying Anand Velankar going through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly.",positive

The print quality is excellent, but this alone cannot hide the fact that the film is deadly boring. There is an exciting opening sequence in which villagers demand a terrible revenge on the Templars (and put the whole thing in motion), but everything else in the film is slow, heavy and ultimately unsatisfactory.

"One of the most significant quotes of the entire film is uttered halfway by the protagonist, the mafia intermediary Titta Di Girolamo, a physically undescribed man, middle-aged originally from Salerno, in southern Italy. When we introduced him at the beginning of the film, he has been living a non-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italian-speaking canton of Switzerland for the last ten years, carrying out a business that is only gradually introduced. In the news, he threatens silently but with laughter to his coercing bank manager to want to close his account. Meanwhile, he tells us, viewers, that when you bluff, you have to bluff to the end without fear of being caught or seem ridiculous. He says: you can’t bluff for a while and Then halfway, tell the truth. Having done this - bluffed only halfway and tell the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of the problems of Titta Di Girolamo. <br /br />This initially unfriendly character, a frowned man, taciturno, tanned on the edge of 50, a man who does not even respond in kind to waitresses and waitresses who say hello and goodbye, becomes a moment in which the viewer cares At one point in his life, Titta decides to be concerned about appearing ""ridiculous."" The first half of the film can be described as ""slow"" by some. In fact, it reveals the days and nights of Di Girolamo in that hotel at a strangely discouraged, deliberate rhythm, revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. However, scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal how essential they are as this masterly and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. Di Girolamo - the man without imagination, identity or life, the unfriendly character that unexpectedly ends up loving and feeling when you least thought it would - is also transmitted with elegantly edited sequences and the very interesting use of music (a theme of the Scottish band Boards of Canada especially highlighted). <br /br />It was never the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat the mafias more at odds than since the release of films like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore or L'Imbalsamatore. Another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist's insomnia. Unlike The Machinist (and in a much more explicit way, the film of Al Pacino Insomnia), Le Conseguenze dell'Amore uses this condition to symbolize a deeper emotional discomfort that has been sunk so deeply into the darkness of the unconscious, it is almost impossible to point out its cause (if in fact there is one). of the legendary Anna) and the memory of Titta’s best friend, a man who has not seen in 20 years, unexpectedly provides a small window to life that Titta eventually (though tentatively at first) accepts to look again. Although he never explicitly speleced, the viewer KNOWS that to a man like Titta, accepting The Consequences of Love will have unimaginable consequences. A film without a single sex or violence scene, a film that develops in his own time and grants nothing to the The expectations of the viewer, Le Conseguenze dell'Amore is a good representative of that small, quiet and discreet Renaissance that has been taking place in Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecittà during the second half of the 70s. The world expects Italy to produce more food like Il Postino, more films of style La Vita è Bella... neglecting to explore beautiful creations such as Le Conseguenze dell'Amore, L'Imbalsamatore and others.

"I saw this movie not expecting much, I got it in a pack of 5 movies, all of which were pretty terrible in their way to under a five so what could I expect? and you know what was right, they were all terrible, this movie has a few (and a few are stretching it) interesting points, the occasional view of the camcorder is a good touch, the battery is very much like a drummer, i.e. fucking annoying and, well, that's really, the problem is that it's so boring, in what I can only suppose was a try to create tension, a lot of nothing happens and when it does its totally tedious (I had my thumb on the fast forward button, ready to press for most of the movie, but gave it a chance) and seriously it is the lead singer of the band that so good looking, because they don't mention half of how beautiful a hell of a lot, I thought it looked a little bit like a suecat, all this and I haven't even mentioned the killer, I won't even get into it, it's just not worth explaining.

Star and London are almost the only reason to see this and with the exception of London (which was actually quite fun) it wasn’t because of its acting talent, I’ve certainly seen much worse, but I’ve also seen much better.

"I bought this movie in Blockbuster for $3.00, because it sounded interesting (a little Ranma-esque, with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton), because there was a cute girl in a miniskirt on the back, and because there was a Restricted View sticker on it. I thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere story of age with a strange indie edge. I was 100% wrong. the little violence, and the closest thing to nudity (Honestly! I don't usually go around waiting!) is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties (see her panties a lot in this movie, because no matter what, she's wearing a miniskirt of some kind). Even anti-religious humor is meek (and lame, caricatured, without sincerity, derivative, not original, and worst of all not fun in the least - it would be better to just listen to Ray Stevens.""Jesus would use a Rolex on his television This could hardly be qualified as PG-13 (not classified), but Blockbuster refuses to allow someone under the age of 17 to rent it--as if it were pornographic.Any young child could go in there and rent the edited version of Requiem for a dream, but they insist that Zack and Reba is worse.<br /br />It is, but not that way.<br /br />In a way, this worries me--the only thing that could offend people is the idea of suicide at first. suicides (not this one, but other better ones like The Virgin Suicides), are teenagers. If the two films were rated R purely because of the suicidal aspect, then I have little chance of turning a story that I have been writing into a PG-13 movie (the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve). Suicide is one of the three main causes of death in adolescents (I think it is number 2), so it is likely that most teenagers have been or will be affected by it.",negative

"Have you ever seen a film that lost the plot? Well, this didn't even have one to start with.<br /br /> Where to start? Painfully tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house without really any sense of threat or even omen created even during seemingly constant electrical storms (which strangely never really be heard in the house-big double glazing)? The house that seems to be just a few miles from a city is still several hours away(?) or the third girl that doesn't serve for the house-big double glazing? the plot except to provide a bloody murder surprisingly fast just when the tedium becomes unbearable? Or even the beginning that suggests a lot of 20+ murders throughout the area, although it is evident that the killer will never venture away from the house? Or the bizarre ritual with salt and pepper that summarizes most of the films lack inherent direction.<br /br />Add a lead actress who can not act but is at least willing to make some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is really unpleasant, but not in the way you expect. <br /br />Given a follow-up simply for being banned in the UK in the 1980s (mostly due to a surprisingly widespread final murder) offers nothing but curious value- and a classic murder 'daft' (don't worry-your telegraphed at least ten minutes before). <br /br />After a walk through the forest our victim arrives at a fairly steep ascending slope that obviously fights up. midway they see a figure on the top dressed in black and waving a large Scythe.

"After sitting through this pile of dung, my husband and I wondered if it was really the product of an experiment to see if a computer program could produce a movie. It was so athletic and formulational. But the U.S. propaganda thrown into his face throughout the film shows - unfortunately - that it is the work of humans. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but quote like, ""We have to steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it"" seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq, etc. The fact that Nicholas Cage threw up lines like, ""I would never use the Declaration of Independence as a bargaining chip"" with a straight face made me and my husband wonder if the whole cast took Valium before filming every scene. The ""reasonation"" behind every twist of the plot and new ""closure"" is really ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there is also an extra plot of misogyny, with Dr. Whatever its name was reprimanded by everyone involved for ""never shutting up."" At one point, Cage's character says, ""Don't you ever shut up?"" and the camera looks at her in pout at her hands, as if she were a child. Truly grotesque.

"This film is based on Han Suyin's book ""A Many Splendored Thing"" and addresses issues of race relations between Asians and whites, a theme that comes from Han's personal experiences as an Eurasian growing in China. That background, and the beautiful Hong Kong scenes, give this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time. <br /br /> Apart from that, the story is a stereotyped romance with a memorable song that may be more remembered than the film itself. Jennifer Jones looks at the role and gives a wonderful, Oscar nominated act as a mixed race doctor during the advent of communism in mainland China. William Holden never looked better playing a romantic track as a journalist covering war-torn regions in the world. The performance is first class, and chemistry between the two lovers provides some genuine moments of the silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined.

"I had heard good things about ""States of Grace"" and came in with an open mind. I thought ""Army of God"" was fine, and I thought that maybe Dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker. The film began with an unstable performance, and I thought, ""Well, maybe it will get better."" Unfortunately, it never did. The photo begins with the introduction of two elders -- Mormon missionaries -- and it seems that the audience will come to know them and grow to worry about them. Instead, history degenerates into a highly degenerate. The only success of Dutcher in this film is his successful alienation from his target audience. By portraying the lives of Mormon missionaries unrealistically and inaccurately, Dutcher achieves nothing but anger at his predominantly Mormon audience. The film in no way reflects reality. Missions are nothing like what Dutcher shows (having served a Mormon mission myself I can attest to this fact) and the lives of gangs in California certainly contain much more explicit language than occasional mild vulgarity.The conclusion, which I assume I should touch the public and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all, was incredible (come on, the whole mission gathers to see this old man sent home - and the mother and the girl are standing right next to Next time, Dutcher, try making a movie that someone can identify with.",negative

"The power and glory of Preston Sturgis were invisible by the public for almost twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when he resurfaced and even appeared on television. Meanwhile he had gained in notoriety because Pauline Kael's book THE CITIZEN had suggested that Herman Mankiewicz's script - Orson Welles for KANE was based on Sturgis' script here. As mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on IMDb's website, Kael excelled his case. about six storytellers who take turns dealing with the life of Charles Foster Kane: the newsman (representing Ralston - the clone of Henry Luce), the memoirs of Thatcher, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane, and Raymond the butler. Each one has his or her different inclination on Kane, reflecting his or her faith or disappointment or hatred towards man. And of course each also reveals his or her own flaws when they are telling his or her version of Kane’s story. This method also leads to frequent superpositions of the narratives of This is not the situation in POWER AND GLORY. Yes, as KANE is a legendary business leader - here is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to be the head of the most successful rail system in the country. But there are only two narrators - they are the right hand of Garner Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This restricts the almost three-dimensional vision that we sometimes have of Kane in Garner. Henry, when he narrates, is Talking about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. His wife is like the voice of the skeptical audience - she sees only the flaws in Henry.<br /br />Typical example: Although he worked his way up, Tom becomes increasingly anti-labour in his later years. Unions are troublemakers, and he doesn't care to be stopped by his mischief. Henry describes Tom's confrontation with the Union in a great abandonment, and how he worried at the expense of his life at home. So we have two points of view of the man, but one is pure white and one is pure black. I’m not really hitting THE POWER AND THE GLORY for not duplicating the success of KANE (a few films do – including all the other Orson Welles movies), but I’m aware that the story is presented well enough to keep your interest to the end. And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore as his wife Sally, the tragedy of the couple's worldly success is completely brought home. <br /br /> When they get married, Tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and family the benefits he never had.But in America the big business success comes at a cost.Tom gets deeply involved with managing the railway empire (expands it and improves it constantly).But he takes it away from home too much, and loses contact with Sally.And he also realizes Eve (Helen Vinson), the youngest woman who When Sally finds out about her unfaithful behavior, she destroys her. Tom also gets a total shock (which makes him a martyr in Henry's eyes). Eva marries Tom, and presents him with a son - but turns out to be Eve's son by Tom's son, Tom Jr. (Philippo Trent). The discovery of this cuckold incestuous makes Tom shoot himself. The film is not a total success - the action sometimes jumps without conviction. Scene when Tom tells his Board of Directors about his plans to buy a small line of rival train, and discusses the use of obligations to finance the plans). Sturgis came from a rich fund, so it could bring this kind of details. So in general it is a top-notch movie.

"Returning to the 36th Chamber is one of those classic Kung-Fu films that Shaw produces in the 1970s and 1980s, whose genre is equivalent to Hollywood's spaghetti westerns, and the protagonist Gordon Liu, the counterpart of Western Clint Eastwood. Digitally remastered and a new impression made for the Fantastic Film Fest, this is ""Presented in Shaw Scope"", as well as the good times.<br /br />This film is a simple story of good against evil, told in 3 acts, which roughly sums up the narrative.

It’s just them fighting throughout the film, which includes a lot of violence (which is basically the whole film) like the blood and guts are constantly flying along the whole thing, and also another graphic rape scene that is being launched pointless to surprise the audience.<br /br /> I would give the Hills Have Eyes II 4 of 10 for pure entertainment, and that alone. Although even then I found myself watching my watch more and more as the film continued, as it began to drag because of the fact that it continued trying to surprise the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make The Hills Have Eyes II is a decent entertainment, something to spend time if you get bored, and nothing else. <br /br />4/10",negative
"I laughed all the way through this rotten movie. It’s so amazing. A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage, has a collapse in front of a real estate office. What’s going on? The office manager comes out and offers him a job!!! Hilarious! The next thing you know the two women are going to go in it. Yes, they’re lesbians! Nothing sounds true in this movie “Life for women with nothing better to do.” There is a rich and distant mother who disapproves of her daughter’s new relationship. A daring black maid – incredible that in 2003, a film is made in which there is a daring black maid. Hattie McDaniel must be turning into her grave. The woman has a husband who is frightened and wants to take care of the young child brats.",negative
"After Hitchcock's successful first American film, Rebecca based on Daphne DuMarier's exuberant novel of gothic romance and intrigue, returned to some of the most familiar themes of her British era: the wrong identity and espionage. As the United States settled in World War II and the large-scale ""war effort"" of civilians building planes, weaponry and other necessary militias, the business of film entertainment began to become paranoid and often jingoist with the war. Knowing that the director was at home in this kind of espionage, producer Jack Skirball approached Hitchcock to direct a property of his property that dealt with corruption, sabotage of war and a defenseless hero got into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity. The darkest elements of narrative and the sharp wit of literary magnate Dorothy Parker (during his A brief stay in Hollywood before returning to her Bohemian roots in New York) who co-authored the script was a perfect match for Hitchcock's sensibilities. <br /br />This often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25-year-old Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) who, while working at a Los Angeles aircraft factory, meets the new employee Frank Frye (Norman Lloydd) and moments later is framed for committing sabotage. These memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of useful 'freaks' and a popular poster model Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) who, during the worst crisis of her life, as well as national security, falls madly in love with! Of course in the land of Hitchcock, Patricia, kidnapped by the supposed saboteur Barry, falls in love with her captor thus adding romantic tension to the mix. A national network of fearful old women, average Joes, and respectable businessmen who fold as secret terrorist agents that harbor criminals, throw weapons and detonate bombs to keep things moving. It’s a fantastic plot that takes their time moving forward and once lit, culminates in one of Hitchcock’s most memorable endings. Look for an incredible life as New York’s tourist attractions (all of which were recreated by Hollywood art directors due to the war of ‘shooting ban’ on public attractions). Saboteur may not be one of Hitchcock's best-known movies, it's a popular movie B that is certainly solid and attractive with a lot of smart plot twists and as usual - fantastic Hitchcock villains. Remember to look for Hitchcock's cameo appearance out of a pharmacy in the second half of the film. Hitchcock's original cameo idea that was filmed (he battling in sign language with his 'defached' wife) was haunted by the Bureau of Standards and Practices who were afraid to offend the deaf!",positive
"I just watched The Dresser tonight, having only seen it once before, a dozen years ago. <br /br />It's not a ""big"" movie, and it doesn't try to make a big splash, but my God, the brilliance of the two lead leaves me almost speechless. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than surprising in this movie. <br /br />The Dresser is the story of Sir, an aged Shakespeare actor (Finney), and his Norman dressing room (Cortenay), a kind of valet, putting in a production of King Lear during the blitz of London in World War II. These are two men, each dependent on the other: Sir is almost helpless without Norman's help to trick, whistle, and harass him to get on stage for his 227th Lear performance. And Norman lives his life vicariously through Sir; without Lord to need him, he is nothing, or thinks he is, anyway. <br /br />This is a film driven by the character; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters, and as such, it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring him to Finney, only 47 years old, is completely believable as a very old actor, very sick, petulant, bullying, but brilliant scenario. Swiss and smoke his fellow actors even when they are taking their bows! And Courtenay is no less convincing as the chopped dressing room, which sometimes must act more like a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer. Employer is really the wrong term to use, although, technically, his relationship is that of employer and employee, most of the time Sir and Norman act like nothing as much as an old married couple. <br /br />Yes, there are others in the cast of this film, but there is no doubt that the real stars are Finney, Courtenay, and Ronald Harwood's wonderful script. That doesn't mean that there are no other fine performances, especially Eileen Atkins as the stage director of long suffering Madge.There is a wonderful scene where Mr and Madge talk about old desires, old regrets, and what might have been. <br /br />Although you don't speak about these days, it is worth remembering that The Dresser was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Actor Nominations for Finney and Courtenay, Best Image, Best Director (Peter Yates), and Best Adapted Screenplay. <br /br /> I had remembered this as being a good movie, but I was not prepared to be as hypnotized as I was from start to finish. If you want to see an example of what the great performance is all about, and be enormously entertaining all the time, then I encourage you to watch The Dresser.",positive
"What happened? What we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast, but somewhere the film loses it. Actually, it never really started. There was a little excitement when we discovered that Angie is not really pregnant, then find out that she is after all, but that was it. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie, was terrible and his whole character wasn’t even close to being important to this movie, apart from doing it. I would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe try not for a pure comedy, which unfortunately wasn't, but maybe a drama with comical elements. I think that if the movie did this it could have been a lot of fun since both actresses are pretty funny in their own ways and sitting here I can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a mutiny.",negative

He offers to marry her by a sense of obligation, but she rejects it and decides to raise the child on her own.

The attempt to redo this in 1990 was just a stupid idea. I guess Midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of Beaches to do this. This (predictably) bombarded. The story is laughable and dated by today’s standards. Even though Midler and Alvarado give good performances this film really drags and I was bored fool in the end. Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason (both good actors) do not help in supporting roles. Flimsy and boring. Really - who thought this would work? See 1937 Stanwyck's version instead.",negative
"A DUCKLING is one of Fulci's previous films (and honestly, in terms of history, better...) - and although it is not the typical ""blood bath"" by which Fulci is known - this is still a very unique and enjoyable movie. <br /br />The story surrounds a small village where a series of child murders are taking place.Some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations - either as suspects, or those ""helping"" the investigation (or in some cases both) - include the city police, a small time journalist, a beautiful and rich former drug addict, a young priest and his mother, an old man who practices witchcraft and his female protégé, a mentally disabled citizen, and a deaf/muda girl. All these people are intertwined in the plot to create several twists and turns, until the real killer reveals himself...<br /br />NO TORTURE A DUCKLING is neither a ""classic"" giallo nor a typical Fulci gore movie.Although it contains elements of both - it is more than an old-fashioned murder mystery, with a darker theme and some scenes of graphic violence (though nothing as strong as some of Fulci’s later works). This is a well-written film with many twists that kept me guessing to the end. Recommended for fans of giallo/murder-mystery, or anyone who wants to watch some of Fulci’s films without splashing – but don’t despair, NOT TORTURE still has more than just part of the violence and sleaze. Some may be postponed by the issue of child killings, and a leading woman character has a strange habit of hitting very young children, which is also kind of puzzling - but if that type of material doesn't bother you, then definitely give this one a look. 8.5/10",positive

"I really like Salman Kahn, so I felt very disappointed when I saw this movie. I didn’t have much of an argument and what they had wasn’t so attractive. Salman however looked good in the movie seemed young and renewed, but it was worth the price of this DVD. The music was not bad that it was quite nice. Generally Indian movies are at least two to three hours long, but this was a very short film for an Indian movie. The American actress that was played in the film is from the Heroes television hit series, Ali Larter. His performance had much to wish for. However, he looked good in the Indian dresses he wore.

"I'm not sure why producers needed to trade in the name of a rather successful film franchise because the title suggests it's a sequel to the first three films..that it isn't.Although Marques Houston appeared in ""HP3"", he played a completely different character (which was, eight years older) in this film.Okay... so Reid and Martin weren't the most talented and couldn't carry a movie by themselves..but to trade with the HP franchise it seems to me that I could have done some kind of I'm sure everyone who wanted to see that I was ""winned"" - thinking they were watching a sequel - not a totally different movie with a family name.

"This film worked along with some of the most predictable storylines and shallow characters ever seen. The writer obviously bought the playbook ""How to Write a Space Disaster Movie"" and continued to play it by game. In particular, the stereotypical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space - putting on a brave spectacle in the face of disaster - has been done over and over again. <br /br />Max Q seems to have been written in the hope that producers would throw $50 million in the But, judging from the second half of the film that contained numerous lame attempts at special effects, producers could only raise $50,000. To know that the film was nominated for a ""Special Visual Effects"" Emmy has me absolutely gob-smacked.<br /br /> I think a handful of high school students with a media pass could have created more credible effects!<br /br />And the plot holes are too numerous to mention.But I'm going to choose one as an example. Now, I'm not a NASA expert, But surely it is highly unlikely that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator will suddenly maintain a position of power in the control room when things begin to go pear-shaped with the program. Surely there is someone more experienced in Mission Control whom the Program Director would call instead of a twenty-nine-year-old who has not been in the control room before.The only saving grace for this film is Bill Campbell's work.

"Caddyshack Two is a good movie by itself, but compared to the original you can’t stack. Robert Stack is a horrible replacement for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason, while fun just can’t compete with Rodney Dangerfield. Ty Webb is fun, being the only character of the original. Most of the other characters in the film lack the punch of the original (Henry Wilcoxon, for example) except for the hysterically funny lawyer Peter Blunt, being played by Randy Quaid.

"Honestly - this short film sucks. the mannequin used in the necro scene is quite well done, but still false enough looking to ruin the viewing experience. the unearthed DVD is clear and clear and I have not decided whether this helps or hinders. If the film was a bit granulated it might have added a little ""deep factor"" to what was going on. I have no idea why this movie has so much hype that it is not the subject - but to be honest the scenes of necrophilia in movies like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q among others, are more shocking than in AFTER MATEH. All this talk about the film that is about loneliness and all other form of deep philosophy is bull****. This is an expensive, beautifully filmed shit. It’s not so shocking, it’s not so disgusting. if you insist on watching it - rent it. I give it a 3 because not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia (there should certainly be a bigger selection for us psychopaths ;) - filming is good and has some gore (if Seeing a rubber-looking doll opens up is considered gore...) but apart from that - absolutely nothing goes for this over-threaded mess.

I look forward to a stray producer to follow with several sequels to these delicious bonbons of kindness of the camp.

With Ed writing the scripts, and a room full of monks creating special crocodile effects on a computer, all we would need would be a crocky cast of forage.

It’s safe to say that it’s a pretty movie without a soul, even if it’s not one of the worst ever made- In this case, they give us a photo crew where the guys are taking some pictures of some girls, nothing too salty, and then through a dense fog they stay in some house one night and they are taken one by one by ""A Killer"" as they are credited.

The script was probably the worst part about it. It was full of silly sequences and laughable dialogues that just killed the mood of the film. It seemed that the screenwriter had a good idea, he just didn't know how to develop it to stretch over ninety minutes of duration. The second half of the film was running out of ideas, the twist was pretty obvious and the end was horrible.<br /br />Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst films in history and he redeemed himself a little with the phone Booth and some other movies, but The Number 23 reminds me that it is still capable of making a stinking movie. It has the film soaked in style but it simply cannot get a good focus. It moves the film at a clumsy and slow pace. It changes from reality to what is really happening in the book that quickly got upset. The real book of the film entitled ""The Number 23"" is a horrible detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to Carrey tell it to bore me to tears. At this point, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. We eagerly wait for the film to reach its horrible end and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that the film is finally over. The performance was mostly normal and quite forgettable. Jim Carrey was clearly sleepwalking through his performance and didn’t even seem to be trying. Some scenes or just very woody. Her narration was a complete boredom to listen to and he didn’t put life into his character. Virginia Madsen did her best with a limited role, but she needed to choose better scripts. Logan Lerman was pretty dull like Danny Huston. Overall, number 23 was a horrible thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or emotions.",negative
"We brought this film as a joke to a friend, and it could be our worst joke to play. The film is barely observable, and the performance is terrible. The worst child actor ever used and Hasslehoff giving a low standard performance. The plot is shameful and at points we were so bored that we wondered what the hell was going on. Try to be horrifying in places but it is simply laughable.",negative
This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life!! It was stupid there was no plot and the special effects were ridiculous!! And I've never seen such a bad performance in my life! The only good part of the movie was all the hot guys (especially Drew Fuller). I don't know what these people were thinking when they did this movie!! I didn't even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves. I mean it was kind of like I would advise anyone who has ever heard of this film and was interested in watching it to simply forget about it and find another movie to watch! I was very disappointed!! The whole film was a complete waste of time in my opinion.,negative
"This is a typical production of Steele novel in which two people who have suffered some kind of tragedy get together despite the odds. I wouldn’t call it a spoiler because anyone who has read a novel Steele knows how ALL end up. If you don’t want to know much about the plot, don’t read on. Gilbert’s character, Ofelia, is a decent French woman who has lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert needs to stop making movies where he is required to have an accent because she, Otherwise a good actress, can not realistically get any kind of accent. Brad Johnson, also an excellent actor, is Matt, who is recovering from a rather unpleasant divorce. He is kind, convincing and convincing in this role. <br /br /> The two meet on the beach through his daughter, Pip, and initially, Ofelia accuses Matt of being a child molester just because he talked about art with the child. They all become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love. <br /br /> two clues is not great, even though the talent of these two people is not, in my opinion, a question. They did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that limits to stereotyped. Two people meet, tragedy, greater tragedy, a secret is revealed, another tragedy, and then they meet. I wish there was more than that, but there it is in a few words. <br /br /> I wanted senseless entertainment, and I got it with this. With regard to the genre of romantic films, this cannot be memorable. ""A Secret Issue"" with Janine Turner is far superior (not a Steele book), as are some of Steele's previous books converted into a movie.",negative
"Oh, it's not one of these attacks from Japanese ghost girl movies... I don't even remember how many I've seen. Maybe it's sold... but not for me. It's not scary at all. Japanese horror movies have been very similar since the first of these... also the pull of the child. I've seen that he threw himself under the scene so many times in so many horror movies. mobile scene is also nothing new... the dramaticity of the guy who gets hit by a bit of a sucking train... I mean he lacked all the drama... OK this is for the kids. 14-16 who listen to Japanese rock and think they are so unique ... let me tell you. there's a million you = D this is one of them. 3/10 I've seen worse, but you won't miss anything for NOT seeing this!",negative
"Nicholas Walker is Paul, the local city's Reverend who is married to Martha (Ally Sheedy), but he is also a regular womanizer and decides to fake his own death to run away with his current affair, Veronica (Dara Tomanovich). However, in doing so, he gets an amnesia fight (hence the name of the film). Sally Kirkland is also at hand as a crazy old woman who pines for the good Reveranda in a tone of ""Misery"" kind of way. It's sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like this. Horribly forgettable role as a poor quality private investigator. In a film called a 'black comedy', you have to bring BOTH elements into that film. Although this brings the first in spades, sadly it does not contain any of the seconds. Also, you cannot emphasize with any of the characters and therefore, you have absolutely no interest in them. Technically it is not a bad movie as a whole just an extremely forgettable one.<br /br />Eye Candy: Dara Tomanovich gets topless; Sally Kirkland also shows some skin My grade: C. Where I saw it: Showtime Showcase",negative
"The Hollywood film industry is the most lazy in the world. It only needs a single blow in flood theatres with the same old shit reinvented over and over again. Take the superheroes, for example, for every X-Man and Spiderman, there are Daredevil, Elektra, Ghost Rider and Hulk. Japanese terror remakes are even worse. It just took The Ring, which was perfect for launch (mostly because of Mr. Gore Verbinsky), to bring a ton of horrors based on similar creepy women, for example, the Ring 2, The Eye, Dark Water (which was Well, but pointless), and the grudges. <br /br /> The first Grudge was not entirely bad. It was scary most of the way, which is what one might expect from it. Also, the plot had some brains mixing narratives. Grudge 2 is exactly like the previous one; this could be a good thing, but hey, what guy Men in Black II? Was it a nice thing xerox the whole script and just change the villain? For Grudge 2, the critic goes the same way. <br /br /> Tired scares, bad acting (except Amber Tamblyn), and There is Aubrey (Tamblyn) investigating what led his sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) to death; Allison (Arielle Kebbel) who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident described in the first film took place; and finally, an American family who witness strange things happening in the apartment next door. I am glad to say (and I mean it) that everything is tied up in the end, but we don’t have to trust the In order to make a good image, when everything else is simply tired and boring. <br /br /> The chills are everywhere, a girl alone in the lockers, someone who should not enter a house, others who dig too deep.Meanwhile, ghosts continue to kill and kill and kill, which seems even more deadly than ten world wars or the Ebola epidemic. Hey, doesn't it seem like just another bad Japanese remake, something called Pulse?Yes, day after day it is easier to hold a grudge... Bullshit.",negative
"""Down Periscope"" has been in our library since it first arrived at VHS. Since then, we have acquired the DVD and a digital Cinema Now.<br /br />It is an extravagant film that does not go militarily overboard as pro or contra. It is, above all, a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters, I am surprised that a sequel has never been offered.<br /br />The film has gained a follow-up that borders a cult obsession, even among the very young. The USS Drum in Mobile, Alabama in 2002. A group of Cub Scouts, my grandson among them, had taken on all the roles of the film and planned to revive it during his night on board. <br /br />It's a fun dance that makes you proud of both our Navy and Hollywood... it's a rare company. <br /br />Thanks to Kelsey Grammar, Lauren Holly and Rob Schneider for doing what might have been a film otherwise not noticeable, so great entertainment!",positive
"If you came here, it's because you've already seen this film and you were curious about what others had to say about it. <br /br />I feel for you, *really* I do.And I apologize profusely as a Canadian (because that's what we do) that this film once had to cross your eyes, even if it was just for a moment.I heard that there is no cure for the retinal bleeding reported from every dozen cases. <br /br />I, like everyone else, rented this film believing it was a stupid B movie scam from Blade. I'm going to give the creators of this film ONE positive comment about their 'creation': Thanks for removing the REC XX/XX/XX from the bottom right corner of the screen. I can see how that would have been a distraction from watching this film. <br /br />And for the album, I *vi* the film, but I didn't see it. The dialogue was inconsistent and most of the scenes took place in my grandmother's trailer, I swear to God. <br /br />You know what? I'm not writing about it anymore. It's too painful.",negative
"Deanna Durbin, Nan Grey and Barbara Read are ""Three Smart Girls"" in this 1936 Universal film, featuring Deanna Durbin to the public. Also starring is Ray Milland, Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, John King, Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady. It is a sweet story about three young women, now living in Switzerland with their divorced mother, who hear that their father (Winninger) is getting married again. Not having seen him in 10 years and knowing that their mother still loves him, embark on a boat to America, with the help of the housekeeper/nanny, determined to stop the wedding. Realizing that the intention, called ""Precious"" (Barnes) is nothing more than a gold excavator aided and instigated by his mother (Brady), they arrange for her to be presented to a rich Count. This is arranged by his father's accountant (King). The man he chooses is a full-time drunk (Auer), but the girls confuse him with a real rich count (Milland). some nice performances, particularly from Auer, Milland, Barnes and Brady. Young women are beautiful and all do good work. The emphasis, of course, is on young Durbin, who is a natural actress and a beautifully trained singer. In fact, her voice as a young man is much more than she would be like an adult - she has no problem with high notes, as she did later because she put too much weight on the mid-voice. She sings a charming ""Il Bacio"" in a police station.<br /br /> The things about the film are to see the father, played by Charles Winninger, do not want his children around - until he sees them and gets to know them. Barnes as the gold seeker is not all so young, but the mother of the girls looks up, so the inference was probably the older man who was looking for his youth with a younger, more glamorous woman. In fact, he finds the young man who was looking for his daughters.<br /br />Universal gives him Durbin the great creation of stars here - she has the latest shot in the film. Ray Milland in This point was still paying her dues, and it will probably be a surprise even for movie fans how young and attractive she is. <br /br />Very entertaining and, of course, this led to a sequel and great stardom for Deanna.",positive
"If someone wonders why no one makes movies like before, with conversation, character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new, better and different, those people need to take in this movie and watch first-class writing, direct and act that melts into a wonderful night of observation about what things were like in Italy and England. Other days, other times, it was channeled into a fantastic comedy of entertainment, made in 1992 with Alfred Molina, Joan Plowright, Polly Walker, Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson and Michael Kitchens in the lead roles. Under the direction of Mike Newell’s brushstroke, these actors perform vividly memorable performances that are photographed with an eye of sublimely subtle painter. Recalling the theatrical farce of the bedroom at the beginning of the century, this film could be called a farce of friendship that becomes a valuable experience in the growth of romantic nature within each character, and the viewer, too. telegram about the importance of caring for those around us.",positive
"I watched this series out of curiosity, wanting to see if they could and with ALL this modern technology, outside of Cecil B. DeMille the classic epic of 1956, starring Charleton Heston, Yul Brenner and Sir Cedric Hardwicke. Of course, I was disappointed. Yes, they had all the right biblical characters, but they didn't give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes, which kept their interest throughout the first film. If you're going to have a mini-series, you have to have some ""devoted"" scenes, the ""burning"" Bush, separating the ""Red Sea"", drowning ""Fharohs Armies"", ""building Pyramids of Sethi"", could have done with today's technology on the scale of successful films like ""Lord of the Rings"" or the Matrix. Obviously, they didn't want to leave a LAST impression of ""faith and sacrifice"", which is much needed in these times of trouble.",negative
"Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile actor alive. English aristocratic snob in A Room With a View, passionate Irish thief in In the Name of the Father, an insolent and violent butcher in Gangs of New York (in a ten times stronger performance than Adrian Brody in the Pianist) and as scandalous Cristy Brown with cerebral palsy in My Left Foot (just to name a few). His roles influence each other, but each one is separate, and totally unique. He changes completely, with each character he assumes. And Christy Brown comes to life. An intelligent man. A scandalous man. Human. Human. This film, despite small stage-transition flaws and the like, is an inspiration. Yes, it is predictable. But is it stupidly sentimental? No. I laughed. I cried. Not a single time of cheese. Proof that this is not a Hollywood. My favorite scene is the scene in the restaurant, when Cristy is talking about painters with Eileen, Peter and his friends. This is where Daniel Day-Lewis arrives at a climax of acting. ""I'm going to kick you into the only part of your anatomy that's animated."" ""Follow the cripple!"" And his performance never slows down, never hesitates, and is beautiful. Simply. He has a lot of screen time here. I see him again, and I never get tired of Cristy's insightful eyes, ticking and guttural. Speeches. <br /br /> A must-see. Fo sho, yo!",positive
"My guess would be that this was originally going to be at least two parts, and therefore at least a quarter longer, because otherwise how can you explain your confusing, abbreviated story. It was never completely lost, but it was often partially lost and usually unclear in the character’s motivation. The film feels as if uniting points from the plot were dropped to squeeze it into its time span.<br /br />If it were longer, it might make more sense, but it would not yet be much good. The most interesting idea of the film is that of the war between Zeus and Hera as a war between man and woman, but the film drops the ball in this, making Hera's followers rather horrible, not being clear on what Zeus' followers do or believe. The film is also interesting because you don't see the gods and there is no real certainty that they exist. So it has a couple of intriguing ideas, but it does nothing useful with them. They're antagonistic, not unobservable, but they're not worth looking at either.",negative
"Well, I like to watch bad B-Movies horrors, because I think it's interesting to see the stupidity and the inability of creators to shoot a really good movie. (I always compare these movies with - for example - some Spielberg plays and again-and-again they don't understand the big difference in what I see.) I like Ed Wood movies because it's so inept that it's really fun. But people!!! ""The Chilling"" is not fun and it's not even ""interesting."" It's EXTREMELY the horror movie without ANYTHING that makes even bad movies. observable. There is no performance, no script, no direction, no emotions and no blood.

You wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen. Unfortunately, it never does. At least with a pet rock in which you knew what you were getting into. Door of the Lion completely cheats on this bomb... No... this is a disaster. After watching this movie, you would swear that George W. Bush had his hands everywhere in the making of this film... yes, it's so stupid.<br /br /> Stay away, unless of course you just want to watch the worst movie of all time.

"I have been a fan of Mario for as long as I can remember, I have very good memories of playing Super Mario World as a child, this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new. Super Mario Galaxy is the latest installment in Mario’s amazing franchise. There is a lot very different about this game from any other Mario before that, while keeping intact the biggest elements of Mario, the first notable difference is that history takes place in space.<br /br />The story begins Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach inviting him to a celebration in his castle in the kingdom of mushrooms. Upon arriving at the castle of Peach Mario finds Bowser and his son (Bowser Jr.) attacking the castle with his airships. Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and then raises his castle to space. In the middle of the castle rising to space Mario falls and lands on an unknown planet. Mario is found by a talking star named Luma and is taken back to the house of the Luma. home, a floating space station, here Mario meets many other Lumas and also meets its leader, a woman named Rosalina. Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser has removed the power stars from the space station and scattered them throughout the universe, it is up to Mario to help the Lumas find them and save Peach, so the adventure begins. fleeting stars to recover the power stars. Mario can on many occasions walk all the way around the planets without losing gravity, some planets are small and others are large, many planets are similar to the classic Mario environments. The best of the game are controls, all things like jumping and such remains the same, but wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game. You shake the remote Mario will make a turn that is used as the main attack in the game, and will also be activated You can also point the remote control on the screen and use the pointer to shoot bits of stars to enemies or objects in the environment. Then there is the graph, these are by far the best graphics on the Wii, it is so hard to describe how big this game looks, you could probably almost say that it looks as good as some 360 games.<br /br /> My only minor complaints is that going face down effect takes some getting used to, and also the story is quite weak. of their lives when you turn off the game, no matter how many you had when you last left you restart in 4 lives. Still these minor problems aside is an excellent game that is highly entertaining and very challenging. This is the kind of game we have been waiting for in the Wii.<br /br /> A perfect 10 of 10!",positive
